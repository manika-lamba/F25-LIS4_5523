## What is User Experience or UX?

*Simply put, user experience is how person feels when they are
interacting with your system or product*

::: notes
Let’s begin by unpacking what we mean when we talk about User
Experience, often abbreviated as UX.

At its core, user experience is about how a person feels when
interacting with a system, product, or service. That includes their
emotions, their perceptions, and even their level of satisfaction. It’s
not just about whether the system works correctly, it’s about whether it
works well for the human using it.

Think of UX as the bridge between technology and people. A product might
have all the right features, but if it’s confusing, frustrating, or
overwhelming to use, the experience will be negative. On the other hand,
even a very simple product can deliver a great user experience if it
feels intuitive, seamless, and even delightful.

So as we move forward in this lecture, keep in mind: **UX is less about
the system itself, and more about the relationship a human has with that
system in practice**. This human-centered perspective is the foundation
of both UX design and information architecture
:::

# ![](images/3.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Now this brings us to an important question: **if user experience is
ultimately about a feeling, how can we possibly design for it?**

The key here is that while we cannot directly design someone’s feelings,
we can design the conditions and interactions that shape those feelings.
In other words, we design the inputs, the interface, the content
structure, the interactions, the flow, and those inputs influence the
outputs, which are the user’s emotions and perceptions.

For example, if a checkout process is confusing, users will likely feel
frustrated. But if it’s streamlined and transparent, they’ll feel more
confident and satisfied. We don’t design the emotion itself, but we
design the path that leads to it.

So as UX designers and information architects, our role is to be
intentional about crafting the environment, structures, and interactions
that guide people toward positive, meaningful, and effective
experiences. This is why research, usability testing, and empathy are so
critical, they help us anticipate how design decisions translate into
user feelings.
:::

## Fundamentals of UX

We need to understand a few basic rules:

![](images/4.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
To design meaningful user experiences, we need to ground ourselves in a
few basic rules. And the very first one is **usefulness**.

No matter how beautiful, intuitive, or engaging a product is, if it
doesn’t meet the user’s needs, it fails at the most fundamental level.
Think of it this way: people don’t come to a product for the aesthetics
alone, they come because they have a problem to solve, a task to
complete, or a goal to reach.

So when we say UX design starts by being useful, we mean that the
product must deliver utility. **It must provide something of value that
directly helps the user.** For example, a note-taking app that doesn’t
let you organize or find your notes isn’t really useful, no matter how
polished it looks.

Usefulness is the core of UX, it’s the center of the concentric circles
you see here. Everything else we’ll talk about in terms of user
experience -- ease of use, desirability, brand experience -— builds
outward from this foundation. If the product isn’t useful, nothing else
really matters.
:::

## Fundamentals of UX (Cont.)

![](images/5.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Once a product is useful, the next question is: **Can people actually
use it?** This is where usability comes in.

A product can provide real value, but if it’s too complicated,
confusing, or frustrating to operate, users won’t stick with it.
Usability is about removing friction—it’s making sure people can
accomplish their goals smoothly and without unnecessary effort.

Think of it like this: a smart thermostat may be incredibly useful in
helping you save energy, but if programming it feels like solving a
puzzle, most people will give up and just set it manually. That means
the value is lost, not because the product lacks utility, but because
the usability fails.

So at this stage of UX, our focus is on clarity, simplicity, and
intuitiveness. We want users to feel, ‘I am able to use this product
easily.’ Usability builds on usefulness—it takes that core utility and
makes it accessible to real people in real contexts.
:::

## Fundamentals of UX (Cont.)

![](images/6.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
After usefulness and usability, the next layer of user experience is
**desirability**. This is where aesthetics and emotional design come
into play -- the way a product looks, feels, and even sounds.

At this level, users aren’t just saying, ‘I can use this product,’
they’re saying, ‘I enjoy using this product.’ Visual design, typography,
colors, animations, and even micro-interactions all contribute to
creating a sense of delight and emotional connection.

For example, think about why people line up for the latest smartphone.
It’s not just about utility or usability, they already know the phone
will work and meet their needs. **What draws them in is the design, the
look and feel, the brand identity, and the emotional satisfaction that
comes from owning and using it**.

So desirability is about creating a positive emotional response. When
users say things like, ‘I love the design, the colors are great, this
product makes me feel happy,’ that’s when we know desirability is at
work. Importantly, though, desirability must build on top of utility and
usability, it can’t compensate for them if they’re missing.
:::

## Fundamentals of UX (Cont.)

![](images/7.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Finally, when usefulness, usability, and desirability all come together,
they contribute to something even bigger: the **overall brand
experience**.

At this stage, users aren’t just judging the product, they’re forming
lasting impressions of the brand behind it. A seamless, enjoyable
experience creates trust and loyalty. People begin to associate positive
feelings with the brand itself, not just the individual interaction.

For example, think about companies like Apple or Starbucks. People don’t
just use their products, they feel connected to the brand. That
connection is shaped by consistent, well-designed experiences that make
them say, ‘My overall feelings about this brand are good. I love this
brand.’

The important point here is that user experience is brand experience.
Every click, every interaction, every frustration or delight becomes
part of how people perceive the brand. Which means good UX design isn’t
just a design choice, it’s a strategic business choice.
:::

# ![](images/9.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
So far, we’ve talked about what makes up a great user experience. But
the question we have to ask next is: **how do we actually achieve that
in practice?**

This is where **design principles, research, and strategy** come into
play. Creating great UX doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of
deliberate choices -- understanding users, structuring information
clearly, designing intuitive interactions, and continually testing and
refining.

We’ll start to explore the methods and tools we use to move from theory
into practice, and this is where information architecture becomes
absolutely central.
:::

## Well, Definitely Not This Way!

:::::

::: notes
Now that we’ve asked how we achieve great user experience, it’s
important to first be clear about **what not to do**.

Too often, design decisions are made based on assumptions, gut feelings,
or what the client likes.

This approach is risky because it relies on speculation rather than
evidence. And if the only validation step is ‘does the client like it?’,
we’re missing the entire point of UX, which is designing for users, not
just stakeholders.

When we work this way, we fall into endless cycles of revisions, chasing
preferences instead of solving real problems. It might get a project
‘done,’ but it rarely creates a product that’s meaningful, effective, or
delightful for the people who actually use it.
:::

## User-Centered Design (UCD) {.smaller}

UCD is a multi-stage problem-solving process that not only requires
designers to analyse and foresee how users are likely to use a product,
but also to test the validity of their assumptions

![](images/13.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This brings us to the right way of approaching UX through User-Centered
Design.

User-Centered Design is not about guessing what users want or simply
pleasing stakeholders, it’s a structured, multi-stage problem-solving
process that keeps the user at the center from start to finish.

It begins with **Discovery**, where we research and observe users to
understand their needs, pain points, and goals. Then we **Define** the
problem clearly because solving the wrong problem is just as bad as no
solution at all.

Next, we **Design** solutions, but instead of assuming they’ll work, we
**Validate** them through testing, prototyping, user feedback, and
usability studies. This ensures we’re not relying on assumptions. After
validation, we **Develop** the solution, and the process loops back
because user needs evolve, and so should the design.

The key idea here is that designers don’t just create interfaces, they
analyze, anticipate, and most importantly, test how real users are
likely to use a product. By doing this, we’re not designing based on gut
feelings, we’re designing based on evidence.
:::

## What is Information Architecture (IA)? {.smaller}

Commonly known as IA, it is the art and science of developing structures
and organization to present data & information

![](images/15.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Now, lets understand the role of Information Architecture or IA, in the
broader context of information system's design.

At the core, IA is about structuring and organizing information so that
users can easily find what they need. Think of it as the blueprint of a
digital product -- the way content is grouped, labeled, and navigated.

IA directly impacts usability because a well-structured system reduces
confusion, helps users complete tasks faster, and ensures they don’t get
lost. But it also ties into the larger picture of user experience.

While UX encompasses the overall feeling and satisfaction a user gets,
IA ensures that the underlying foundation -- the pathways, categories,
and hierarchies -- is clear and logical.

In short, IA is the art and science of turning data and information into
meaningful structures. Without it, even the most visually appealing
designs can feel overwhelming or unusable.

## 3 Focus of IA

![](images/18.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This slide breaks down the three key pillars of Information
Architecture.

First, **Navigation and Labeling**: This is about creating clear
signposts for users so they know where they are and where they can go.
Just like road signs, navigation and labels need to be intuitive and
consistent so people don’t get lost.

Second, **Content Organisation**: This involves structuring information
logically. Whether it’s grouping related content, creating hierarchies,
or deciding what belongs where — good organisation ensures users can
find what they need quickly, without unnecessary searching or confusion.

Finally, **Information Storage and Retrieval**: This is about how data
is stored behind the scenes and how easily it can be retrieved when
needed. Think of it like a well-organized filing system — if the system
is structured properly, both the product and the users can quickly pull
out the right information at the right time.

Together, these elements form the backbone of Information Architecture
and directly shape how usable and accessible a digital product becomes.

## This is Your Website

![](images/19.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
Here I use a house blueprint as an analogy for your website. 

Just as a house needs a solid architectural plan before you start building, a website needs a clear information structure. The blueprint represents the underlying design that determines how visitors will move through and experience your site. 

Without a plan, even a visually attractive site can be confusing and hard to use.
:::

## Navigation and Labeling

:::::

:::notes
These floor‑plan diagrams illustrate the importance of navigation and labeling. 

Just like labels on rooms help you find the kitchen or bedroom, clear labels on a website guide visitors to the right section.

The labeling must be intuitive and consistent; if someone has to guess what a label means, they’re likely to get lost. 

Good navigation is about both naming things well and organizing them in a way that feels natural.
:::

## Questions

-   Why did we put the living room in the middle?
-   Why is the kitchen near the dining room?
-   Why did we put the family bedrooms upstairs?
-   Why is the playroom downstairs?

![](images/22.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide poses a series of questions about why certain rooms are placed where they are. 

Use it to encourage critical thinking about layout decisions — for example, why put the kitchen near the dining room or bedrooms upstairs? Then introduce the twist: ‘Grandma has a bad back and can’t do stairs.’ 

Understand that real users have specific needs, and that architects and information architects must accommodate those needs.
:::

## Revising -- Navigation and Labeling

![](images/23.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
Here we see a revised floor plan with Grandma’s room moved to the first floor. 

IA is iterative -- once you learn about user constraints, you adjust the layout. This mirrors the process of redesigning a website’s navigation when you discover accessibility issues or changing user requirements. The lesson is to be flexible and user‑centered.
:::

## Content Organisation

`Everything (now/future) has a place`

![](images/24.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide represents the idea of Content Organisation. Just like in a house, where each room has a clear purpose and every item has its rightful place, information systems need to be organized so that everything -- both now and in the future -- has a designated location.

Think about it: the living room holds the sofa, TV, and coffee table; the bathroom has the sink, shower, and toilet; the kitchen is for cooking equipment; and the dining room is for meals. The structure ensures we always know where to look for something, and it reduces confusion.

In the same way, when designing digital spaces or websites, we must create logical categories and hierarchies where all current content fits and where future additions can also be placed seamlessly. Good content organization makes navigation intuitive and sustainable over time.
:::

## Information Storage & Retrieval

Where does eating utensils go?

![](images/25.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide highlights the concept of Information Storage & Retrieval in Information Architecture. 

The question here is simple but powerful: Where do eating utensils go? Should they be stored in the kitchen with the stove and cooking utensils, or in the dining room with the table and chairs?

This is the exact challenge IA faces. It’s not just about organizing content -- it’s about putting things where users expect to find them. If someone is looking for utensils, their mental model will guide whether they search the kitchen or the dining room.

The takeaway is that storage decisions must align with user expectations, not just what seems logical from the creator’s perspective. A well-architected website, like a well-designed house, makes information easy to retrieve by placing it where users naturally look for it.
:::

# ![](images/26.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
Now that we’ve covered the basic concept of Information Architecture — what it is and why it matters — the next big question is: **how do we actually put it into practice?**

It’s one thing to understand IA as the art and science of organizing and structuring information, but implementation requires concrete methods, tools, and processes. 

On the upcoming slides, we’ll walk through practical strategies from organizing content and defining navigation to labeling systems and retrieval methods.
:::

## IA Output: Sitemap

![](images/27.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
A sitemap is essentially the blueprint of a digital product, laying out how all the content is structured and connected. Here, you can see how the site is divided into clear sections -- the header and utility navigation, the main navigation, and the footer links.

For example, under ‘Our Products,’ users can drill down into specific categories like Stay Fresh, Oil, or Pimples. Under ‘Skin Facts & Fiction,’ we see subcategories like acne, skin tips, and skin types — all organized logically.

The sitemap makes sure users know where to find what they’re looking for, and it helps designers and developers build consistent navigation. In short, it ensures that everything has its place, and users can get there efficiently.

**This output is critical before moving into wireframes or design**, because it aligns everyone on the content structure and user pathways.
:::

## IA Output: Sitemap (Cont.)

![](images/28.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide expands on the sitemap we saw earlier by showing a more detailed breakdown of content types and page templates.

Notice how each section now includes not just the navigation structure but also the content type and purpose of the page. 

For example, under ‘Our Products,’ we see a product category landing page that leads to specific product detail pages. Under ‘Skin Facts & Fiction,’ each topic like ‘Acne & Pimples’ or ‘Skin Types’ is identified as an article detail page.

Similarly, in ‘Real Faces, Real Stories,’ the site includes personal sections such as ‘Girls Like Me’ or ‘My Skin Routine.’ And in ‘Spotlight,’ we find promotional or topical content like product buzz and chatter.

The footer and header remain consistent, giving users easy access to utility pages such as Contact, About, Privacy Policy, and Sitemap.

This level of detail helps not just in organizing the navigation but also in aligning with the content strategy -- making sure every page has a clear role, whether it’s a landing page, an article detail, or a product page. Ultimately, it ensures the user journey is intuitive and complete.
:::

# ![](images/34.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide explains how conceptual design bridges the gap between research and the first draft of a product. 

Conceptual design is where ideas begin to take shape. It’s a creative but structured process. Inputs come from user research, such as personas, as well as broader research insights, the designer’s creativity, and sometimes even direct user involvement through co-design workshops.

Within this phase, teams use methods like scenarios, design probes, sketching, brainstorming, and workshops to explore different directions. 

The output is not yet the final product, but rather a product draft -- a concrete starting point that can be refined and tested. This stage is about turning abstract needs into tangible concepts that can later be evaluated and iterated.
:::

## Draft Product

![](images/35.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
Here we see what the product draft can look like in practice. This stage is about giving form to ideas so that they can be shared, tested, and refined.

The draft can take several different forms depending on the fidelity needed:

- **Sketches** are quick, low-cost representations of ideas that help visualize early concepts.

- **Storyboards** go a step further, showing user interactions or scenarios in sequence.

- **Wireframes** map out the structure of a page or screen, focusing on layout rather than visuals.

- **Mockups** add detail, color, and branding, making the design look closer to the final product.

- Finally, **Prototypes** bring in interactivity, allowing users and stakeholders to test flows and functionality.

Each of these is not a finished product but a way to communicate, explore, and validate design decisions before committing to development.
:::

## Sketches 

![](images/36.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
Here we see how sketches play an important role in UX design. Sketches are not about creating art -- they are rough, quick ways to generate and explore ideas.

There are two main types shown here:

1. **Thumbnail sketches**: These are small, fast drawings that allow us to generate many different concepts very quickly. They’re about volume and variety, helping us brainstorm multiple directions without investing too much time.

2. **Screen sketches**: These go deeper by exploring the content, layout, and functionality of a screen. They’re closer to what the interface might look like, but still loose enough to encourage iteration.

Sketches are a UX designer’s fundamental creativity tool. They help teams document and communicate ideas early on, without the pressure of being perfect. At this stage, the goal is exploration, not refinement.
:::

## Storyboards Made Out of Hand Sketches

![](images/37.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
Now, let’s talk about storyboards in UX design.

Unlike individual sketches, storyboards link together a sequence of screens to show how an interaction will actually flow. The idea is to map out not just what a single page looks like, but how the user moves from one step to another.

For example, in this storyboard we see a job search application:

- The user starts by entering a profession and location.

- Then they see search results and can save, apply, or view a job on the map.

- From there, they can dive deeper into details or move into the application process.

This chain of connected sketches helps us explore narratives of user interaction. It allows us to ask: 

- Does the flow make sense? 
- Are there any unnecessary steps? 
- Where might users get stuck?

Storyboards are especially valuable because they simulate real use cases in a simple, visual way. They’re not about visual polish, but about telling a story of how the product works in practice. In other words, they help designers and stakeholders see the big picture of the user journey before investing in high-fidelity designs.
:::

## Wireframe

![](images/38.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide introduces us to **wireframes**, which are one of the most important tools in UX design.

Wireframes are essentially **blueprints of a digital product**. They are more precise than sketches and storyboards—sizes are often close to pixel-perfect. While they can still be hand-drawn, most wireframes today are created with design tools to show layout, structure, and interactivity.

What’s important to note here is that wireframes **focus on functionality and usability** rather than aesthetics. There’s no color, branding, or typography. Instead, placeholders for images, menus, and links show how different components fit together.

On the left side, you can see a sample wireframe of an e-commerce homepage. It outlines:

- The logo and search bar at the top
- Navigation menus on the left and top
- Featured content like seasonal items in the center
- Links to promotions, offers, or registries
- Footer information at the bottom

On the right, there’s a table that describes each element in detail -- its type and function. This documentation ensures that developers and designers are aligned on what each component is supposed to do.

Therefore, **wireframes strip away visual distraction**, allowing us to test **usability and flow first**. 

It’s about asking

- Does this structure make sense to the user? 
- Can they find what they’re looking for? 

Only once we’re confident in the flow do we move into adding colors, typography, and branding.
:::

## Mockup

![](images/39.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide shows how we move from **wireframes** to **mockups**.

A wireframe, as we just discussed, gives us the structure: layout, content placement, functionality, and interactions. But wireframes are deliberately plain and don’t include any visual design elements.

To turn a wireframe into something more realistic, we add a **graphic design layer**. This includes the **color scheme**, **typography**, branding elements, and sometimes images. Once we combine the functionality of wireframes with the aesthetics of graphic design, we get **mockups**.

Mockups are useful because they help us and our stakeholders **envision what the final product will look like**. They communicate the brand identity and style while staying true to the structure defined in the wireframe.

In other words, wireframes answer the question: *How will it work?*
Mockups answer the question: *How will it look?*
:::

## Prototype

![](images/40.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide introduces us to **prototypes**, which are where our ideas start to come alive.

A prototype is essentially a set of screens, whether sketches, wireframes, or mockups, that are **linked together to simulate interaction**. They can be as simple as paper sketches that you flip through, or as advanced as clickable digital versions made with prototyping tools like Axure or Sketch.

The key point is that prototypes give us a way to **test and envision how a product will work before investing time and resources in coding**. By making interactions tangible early on, we can validate whether the flow makes sense, identify usability issues, and gather user feedback quickly.

Prototypes don’t need to be perfect, they can be rough or refined, but their power lies in allowing us to **try things out and iterate** before moving to development.

In short, prototypes bridge the gap between concept and reality.
:::

## Why do we need IA?

![](images/29.png){fig-align="center"}

:::notes
This slide highlights three essential aspects of how users find and interact with our digital content.

First, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) ensures that users can actually find our website in the first place. If we don’t show up in search results, users may never even reach us.

Second, once users are on the site, findability becomes critical. This is about helping users locate the specific piece of information they came for whether that’s a product, a fact, or a service. A well-structured site makes information easy to locate.

Finally, navigation ensures users always know where they are within the site and how to move around. Clear labeling, consistent menus, and logical pathways prevent confusion and frustration.

Together, these three -- SEO, findability, and navigation -- form the backbone of a successful information architecture, guiding users seamlessly from discovery to content.

## Findability \~ Information Scent {.smaller}

`Is an analogy that compares how humans seek information with animals seeking food`

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Refers to the extent to which users can predict what’s ahead (in a

:::notes
Now, let me introduce the concept of information scent, a powerful analogy in UX. Just like animals follow a scent trail to find food, users follow ‘information scents’ to find what they need on a website.

Information scent is essentially the cues we give users -- things like page titles, menu labels, and link text -- that help them predict what lies ahead. If the scent is strong and matches their expectations, they’ll keep moving forward confidently.

But if the cues are vague, misleading, or don’t match the actual content, users will feel tricked or frustrated. This often leads them to leave the site altogether.

So, when designing, we need to make sure every link, label, or heading gives a clear idea of what users will find, and that the payoff matches their expectations. Strong information scent makes navigation intuitive and builds trust in the experience.
:::

## Information Scent {.smaller}

> When Information scent says to the user -- `YOU’RE GETTING CLOSER!`

> It helps visitors know that your site is fertile hunting grounds for the things they are looking for



![](images/31.png){fig-align="center" width="2000"}

:::notes
The information scent can guide users as they navigate through a site. When users feel that every step is taking them closer to what they’re searching for, it reinforces their confidence and keeps them engaged.

Think of it like following a trail: if the labels, headings, or categories they encounter match their expectations, users feel reassured that they’re on the right path. 

For example, in this diagram, if someone wants to learn about the beliefs of Scientology, they’ll see clear paths like Beliefs on Marriage or Beliefs on Paradise. Each of these reinforces that they’re moving closer to the specific information they want.

In other words, strong information scent tells users, ‘You’re getting warmer, keep going!’, making your site feel like fertile hunting grounds where their effort will pay off.

## IA Impacts Heavily on Search Engine’s View of Your Site {.smaller}

- Search engines index (scan) your site hierarchically
- Pages higher in the hierarchy are given more weight
- SEO also make note of silos of info and relationships
- Well architected site makes information more findable

![](images/32.png){fig-align="center" width="2000"}

:::notes
Now, let's see how information architecture impacts search engines and, ultimately, your site’s visibility. 

Search engines scan your website hierarchically, meaning that pages higher up in the hierarchy, like the homepage or top-level categories, carry more weight in search rankings.

As we move down into subcategories or deeper pages, the weight decreases. That’s why structuring your site properly is so important because search engines not only read content, but also evaluate how information is grouped into silos and how different sections are related.

A well-architected site not only helps users find what they’re looking for, but it also helps search engines understand and trust your content. This increases your chances of ranking higher and being more discoverable. Thus, good IA boosts both usability and SEO.
:::

## Sitemaps and Menus that Reflect IA Leads to Greater Findability {.smaller}

- Help users know what’s available and find what they are looking for
- Tell users where they are within the site
- Tell users how to use the site by quickly communicating features
- Give users a reference point

![](images/33.png){fig-align="center" width="2000"}

:::notes
Finally, let's look at how visual cues in sitemaps and menus can greatly improve findability. 

When your navigation reflects a clear information architecture, users can easily understand what’s available and where to go to find what they’re looking for.

Notice in the example:

- The active view in the menu shows the user exactly which section they’re in
- A large, clear heading like Apple Store reinforces context
- And breadcrumbs provide a step-by-step trail so users know where they are in the hierarchy and how to navigate back

These cues don’t just orient users, they also teach them how to use your site by quickly communicating its structure and features. In other words, they give users a reference point, reducing confusion and making the experience more intuitive and efficient.
