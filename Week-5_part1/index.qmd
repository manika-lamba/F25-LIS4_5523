## What is User Experience or UX?

*Simply put, user experience is how person feels when they are
interacting with your system or product*

Let’s begin by unpacking what we mean when we talk about User
Experience, often abbreviated as UX.

At its core, user experience is about how a person feels when
interacting with a system, product, or service. That includes their
emotions, their perceptions, and even their level of satisfaction. It’s
not just about whether the system works correctly, it’s about whether it
works well for the human using it.

Think of UX as the bridge between technology and people. A product might
have all the right features, but if it’s confusing, frustrating, or
overwhelming to use, the experience will be negative. On the other hand,
even a very simple product can deliver a great user experience if it
feels intuitive, seamless, and even delightful.

So as we move forward in this lecture, keep in mind: **UX is less about
the system itself, and more about the relationship a human has with that
system in practice**. This human-centered perspective is the foundation
of both UX design and information architecture

::: notes
Now this brings us to an important question: **if user experience is
ultimately about a feeling, how can we possibly design for it?**

The key here is that while we cannot directly design someone’s feelings,
we can design the conditions and interactions that shape those feelings.
In other words, we design the inputs, the interface, the content
structure, the interactions, the flow, and those inputs influence the
outputs, which are the user’s emotions and perceptions.

For example, if a checkout process is confusing, users will likely feel
frustrated. But if it’s streamlined and transparent, they’ll feel more
confident and satisfied. We don’t design the emotion itself, but we
design the path that leads to it.

So as UX designers and information architects, our role is to be
intentional about crafting the environment, structures, and interactions
that guide people toward positive, meaningful, and effective
experiences. This is why research, usability testing, and empathy are so
critical, they help us anticipate how design decisions translate into
user feelings.

## Fundamentals of UX

We need to understand a few basic rules:

![](images/4.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
To design meaningful user experiences, we need to ground ourselves in a
few basic rules. And the very first one is **usefulness**.

No matter how beautiful, intuitive, or engaging a product is, if it
doesn’t meet the user’s needs, it fails at the most fundamental level.
Think of it this way: people don’t come to a product for the aesthetics
alone, they come because they have a problem to solve, a task to
complete, or a goal to reach.

So when we say UX design starts by being useful, we mean that the
product must deliver utility. **It must provide something of value that
directly helps the user.** For example, a note-taking app that doesn’t
let you organize or find your notes isn’t really useful, no matter how
polished it looks.

Usefulness is the core of UX, it’s the center of the concentric circles
you see here. Everything else we’ll talk about in terms of user
experience -- ease of use, desirability, brand experience -— builds
outward from this foundation. If the product isn’t useful, nothing else
really matters.
:::

## Fundamentals of UX (Cont.)

![](images/5.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Once a product is useful, the next question is: **Can people actually
use it?** This is where usability comes in.

A product can provide real value, but if it’s too complicated,
confusing, or frustrating to operate, users won’t stick with it.
Usability is about removing friction—it’s making sure people can
accomplish their goals smoothly and without unnecessary effort.

Think of it like this: a smart thermostat may be incredibly useful in
helping you save energy, but if programming it feels like solving a
puzzle, most people will give up and just set it manually. That means
the value is lost, not because the product lacks utility, but because
the usability fails.

So at this stage of UX, our focus is on clarity, simplicity, and
intuitiveness. We want users to feel, ‘I am able to use this product
easily.’ Usability builds on usefulness—it takes that core utility and
makes it accessible to real people in real contexts.
:::

## Fundamentals of UX (Cont.)

![](images/6.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
After usefulness and usability, the next layer of user experience is
**desirability**. This is where aesthetics and emotional design come
into play -- the way a product looks, feels, and even sounds.

At this level, users aren’t just saying, ‘I can use this product,’
they’re saying, ‘I enjoy using this product.’ Visual design, typography,
colors, animations, and even micro-interactions all contribute to
creating a sense of delight and emotional connection.

For example, think about why people line up for the latest smartphone.
It’s not just about utility or usability, they already know the phone
will work and meet their needs. **What draws them in is the design, the
look and feel, the brand identity, and the emotional satisfaction that
comes from owning and using it**.

So desirability is about creating a positive emotional response. When
users say things like, ‘I love the design, the colors are great, this
product makes me feel happy,’ that’s when we know desirability is at
work. Importantly, though, desirability must build on top of utility and
usability, it can’t compensate for them if they’re missing.

::: notes
Finally, when usefulness, usability, and desirability all come together,
they contribute to something even bigger: the **overall brand
experience**.

At this stage, users aren’t just judging the product, they’re forming
lasting impressions of the brand behind it. A seamless, enjoyable
experience creates trust and loyalty. People begin to associate positive
feelings with the brand itself, not just the individual interaction.

For example, think about companies like Apple or Starbucks. People don’t
just use their products, they feel connected to the brand. That
connection is shaped by consistent, well-designed experiences that make
them say, ‘My overall feelings about this brand are good. I love this
brand.’

The important point here is that user experience is brand experience.
Every click, every interaction, every frustration or delight becomes
part of how people perceive the brand. Which means good UX design isn’t
just a design choice, it’s a strategic business choice.

# ![](images/9.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
So far, we’ve talked about what makes up a great user experience. But
the question we have to ask next is: **how do we actually achieve that
in practice?**

This is where **design principles, research, and strategy** come into
play. Creating great UX doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of
deliberate choices -- understanding users, structuring information
clearly, designing intuitive interactions, and continually testing and
refining.

We’ll start to explore the methods and tools we use to move from theory
into practice, and this is where information architecture becomes
absolutely central.

::: notes
Now that we’ve asked how we achieve great user experience, it’s
important to first be clear about **what not to do**.

Too often, design decisions are made based on assumptions, gut feelings,
or what the client likes.

This approach is risky because it relies on speculation rather than
evidence. And if the only validation step is ‘does the client like it?’,
we’re missing the entire point of UX, which is designing for users, not
just stakeholders.

When we work this way, we fall into endless cycles of revisions, chasing
preferences instead of solving real problems. It might get a project
‘done,’ but it rarely creates a product that’s meaningful, effective, or
delightful for the people who actually use it.
:::

## User-Centered Design (UCD) {.smaller}

UCD is a multi-stage problem-solving process that not only requires
designers to analyse and foresee how users are likely to use a product,
but also to test the validity of their assumptions

![](images/13.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This brings us to the right way of approaching UX through User-Centered
Design.

User-Centered Design is not about guessing what users want or simply
pleasing stakeholders, it’s a structured, multi-stage problem-solving
process that keeps the user at the center from start to finish.

It begins with **Discovery**, where we research and observe users to
understand their needs, pain points, and goals. Then we **Define** the
problem clearly because solving the wrong problem is just as bad as no
solution at all.

Next, we **Design** solutions, but instead of assuming they’ll work, we
**Validate** them through testing, prototyping, user feedback, and
usability studies. This ensures we’re not relying on assumptions. After
validation, we **Develop** the solution, and the process loops back
because user needs evolve, and so should the design.

The key idea here is that designers don’t just create interfaces, they
analyze, anticipate, and most importantly, test how real users are
likely to use a product. By doing this, we’re not designing based on gut
feelings, we’re designing based on evidence.

## What is Information Architecture (IA)? {.smaller}

Commonly known as IA, it is the art and science of developing structures
and organization to present data & information

![](images/15.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Now, lets understand the role of Information Architecture or IA, in the
broader context of information system's design.

At the core, IA is about structuring and organizing information so that
users can easily find what they need. Think of it as the blueprint of a
digital product -- the way content is grouped, labeled, and navigated.

IA directly impacts usability because a well-structured system reduces
confusion, helps users complete tasks faster, and ensures they don’t get
lost. But it also ties into the larger picture of user experience.

While UX encompasses the overall feeling and satisfaction a user gets,
IA ensures that the underlying foundation -- the pathways, categories,
and hierarchies -- is clear and logical.

In short, IA is the art and science of turning data and information into
meaningful structures. Without it, even the most visually appealing
designs can feel overwhelming or unusable.

## 3 Focus of IA

![](images/18.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This slide breaks down the three key pillars of Information
Architecture.

First, **Navigation and Labeling**: This is about creating clear
signposts for users so they know where they are and where they can go.
Just like road signs, navigation and labels need to be intuitive and
consistent so people don’t get lost.

Second, **Content Organisation**: This involves structuring information
logically. Whether it’s grouping related content, creating hierarchies,
or deciding what belongs where — good organisation ensures users can
find what they need quickly, without unnecessary searching or confusion.

Finally, **Information Storage and Retrieval**: This is about how data
is stored behind the scenes and how easily it can be retrieved when
needed. Think of it like a well-organized filing system — if the system
is structured properly, both the product and the users can quickly pull
out the right information at the right time.

Together, these elements form the backbone of Information Architecture
and directly shape how usable and accessible a digital product becomes.

## IA Impacts Heavily on Search Engine’s View of Your Site {.smaller}

- Search engines index (scan) your site hierarchically
- Pages higher in the hierarchy are given more weight
- SEO also make note of silos of info and relationships
- Well architected site makes information more findable

## Sitemaps and Menus that Reflect IA Leads to Greater Findability {.smaller}

- Help users know what’s available and find what they are looking for
- Tell users where they are within the site
- Tell users how to use the site by quickly communicating features
- Give users a reference point
