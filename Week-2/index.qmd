Hello everyone! This week's lecture provides you with a brief overview
of information retrieval (IR) systems, users of IR systems, and the
topics we will cover in this course.

In this class we will learn about online information retrieval. The
first part of class will focus on the **HOW** of information retrieval
systems: how they work, how they are structured, different IR models and
technologies, and the role that users play when designing an information
retrieval system.

The second part of class will introduce you to searching strategies that
will make you a better searcher in many different systems.

Lastly, in the third part of class you will use your new search skills
in various databases and on the Web.

Knowing how systems work, the decisions made while developing them, and
how they are structured will make you a better searcher. Understanding
yourself as a searcher will also help you identify areas you need to
strengthen as you use online systems for your own work but also to help
others conduct searches.

So, let's get started!

The idea of doing information retrieval is driven by one fundamental
fact, and that is the digital revolution.The digital revolution happened
extremely quickly and profoundly. For example, the figures shown on the
slide is taken from [Hilbert and Lopez
(2011)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1200970) paper which
showed that the in the late '80s, 99% of the information in the world
was stored in analogue form, for example on papers. Then, the digital
part of information grew but then after the year 2000, it just exploded.
They estimated that in the year 2002, for the first time, the world was
able to store more digital than analog information. We still have papers
around but by now, digital information counts for more than 99% of all
the information.

So in the year 2014, when they last updated the data, they found that
the world was able to store five zettabytes. How far is five zettabytes?
If you would take all this information that you have on your hard disk
and your cell phones and microchips on the back of your credit card, and
you would put this in books, and you would make a pile, how high do you
think the pile would reach? Would reach to the moon? Or to the sun?

It will reach 4,500 times to the sun!! So there will be 4,500 piles from
the Earth to the sun with books. So, in 2014, we had 4,500 piles of
books. That's all we were able to accumulate during human history, and
now we're doubling it ever since.

So, we restore as much new information as all the information we were
ever able to, there's a lot of information to dig into and all the time
you're producing a lot more and it's in digital format. That means then
we need a system to compute it and use some system in order to retrieve
it.

We live in a time where we’re constantly generating new information and
not just a little, but as much as we’ve ever been able to capture. Every
day, more knowledge is being produced, and now it’s all in digital form.
That’s powerful, because digital information can be stored and preserved
almost endlessly.

But here’s the challenge: with so much of it out there, we can’t rely on
memory or manual systems anymore. We need computational systems to make
sense of it --- to process, organize, and connect it. And just as
important, we need retrieval systems so that when we ask a question, we
can actually pull the right piece of knowledge out of that vast ocean of
data.

So, it’s not just about storing information, it’s about creating the
ability to use it --- instantly, effectively, and intelligently.

::: notes
Now, let's define Information Retrieval (IR). It is a process of
matching a particular document with a set of other relevant documents.
Suppose you have an extensive collection of documents and you want to
find a relevant document. This text mining task retrieves the relevant
documents based on the best matches of input document with the
collection of documents based on a similarity measure.

In other words, IR is about bridging the gap between the user’s question
and the vast universe of available information.

::: notes
Now, what does that actually involve? As you see on this slide, IR is
not just about search in the narrow sense. It encompasses several key
components:

On the left side, we have the foundational activities —-- things like
representation, which is how we describe documents; storage and
organization, which ensure information can be managed at scale; and
techniques such as document clustering and classification, which group
or categorize information meaningfully. And of course, all of this
requires careful consideration of system architecture, the technical
backbone of IR.

On the right side, we move into more advanced or applied aspects --—
information and data visualization, which helps users interpret results;
allied services, which extend retrieval into related tasks; ranking of
documents, which determines which results appear most relevant; semantic
linking, which connects related pieces of knowledge; and filtering,
which helps reduce noise and personalize outputs. These ensure that IR
is not just functional, but also efficient and user-centered.

Finally, it’s worth emphasizing that search engines, which we all use
daily, are the most visible application of these IR principles. The
concepts and techniques you see here form the foundation of systems like
Google, Bing, and countless specialized retrieval platforms.

::: notes
*`{Zoom-in to see the figure or Right-click to save it!}`*

Information retrieval systems today are based on techniques that were
introduced in the 1960s and while the abilities of systems and the
algorithms used have been refined, the process of retrieval remains the
same.

IR is primarily text-based, meaning that we retrieve documents, those
documents may be textual, we use queries that are text, and we search
representations that are text. There are definitely other forms of IR
and other formats of documents that are retrieved but regardless the
process remains the same.

In database systems, whether a flat file system or relational database,
each field that is indexed (meaning it is searchable by users) produces
what is called an inverted index of index terms. It is this index that
is searched.

Even web search engines like Google use inverted indexes and when you
search the engine, you are searching the index of terms. Of course there
are other systems that provide full text searching or even full document
searching, but there are also limits to what is searched in each.

We will talk more about IR models and how they work in systems later in
the course.

IR is no longer just a problem for libraries. IR systems are used
everywhere and by anyone who has an Internet connection via their
computer, smart phone, tablet or other mobile device.

::: notes
The SMART system, or System for the Mechanical Analysis and Retrieval of
Text, was one of the earliest and most influential projects in
Information Retrieval. It was developed in the 1960s at Cornell
University by Gerard Salton, who is often considered the father of IR.

What made SMART so important is that it wasn’t just a system, it was a
research platform. It introduced and tested many of the core ideas that
modern search engines still rely on. For example, SMART gave us the
**vector space model**, representing documents and queries
mathematically so that we could measure similarity. It also introduced
**term weighting methods** like TF-IDF, which balance how frequent a
word is within a document against how rare it is across the collection.

Another innovation was **relevance feedback**, the idea that the system
can improve results by learning from what the user marks as relevant or
irrelevant. And just as importantly, it also developed **evaluation
methods**, such as precision and recall, to measure retrieval
effectiveness in a systematic way.

While the SMART system itself no longer exists, its principles form the
foundation of everything from academic IR research to commercial search
engines like Google today.

:::
:::::

::: notes
In the late 1960s, researchers began thinking about how information
retrieval systems could move beyond simple text search. One key idea
came from J.W. Sammon in 1969, who proposed a visualization interface
integrated into IR systems. In his influential paper, A Nonlinear
Mapping for Data Structure Analysis, he laid the groundwork for
techniques that help us see patterns in data, something that’s become
critical in modern IR with clustering and visualization tools.

Around the same time, the first online IR systems were emerging.
Examples include the National Library of Medicine’s AIM-TWX and MEDLINE,
Lockheed’s Dialog, and SDC’s ORBIT. These systems were groundbreaking
because they provided searchable access to specialized literature,
especially in science and medicine, long before the web existed.

And during 1966–67, F.W. Lancaster conducted a major evaluation of
MEDLARS, the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System. His
studies were among the first systematic evaluations of an IR system,
focusing on how effective it was in retrieving relevant documents. This
was crucial, because it marked the beginning of formal evaluation
practices in IR, something that still defines the field today.

## Brief History of Information Retrieval

-   [AM SIGIR Conference]{style="color: blue;"} started in 1978 which
    subsequently emerged as the apex conference in IR systems

-   Belkin, Oddy, and Brooks gave the concept of [*Anomalous State of

    retrieval in 1982

-   [OKAPI model]{style="color: blue;"} was formulated in 1982-88 which
    is a set-oriented ranked output design for probabilistic type
    retrieval of textual material using inverted index

-   Major breakthrough was in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee proposed [World
    Wide Web]{style="color: blue;"} in CERN Laboratory

-   [TREC conference]{style="color: blue;"} started as part of TIPSTER
    text program in 1992 and it was sponsored by US Defense and National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

::: notes
Next in 1978, the ACM SIGIR Conference began. Over time, it became the
leading international conference on IR systems, what we often call the
‘apex’ conference in the IR field.

Then, in 1982, Belkin, Oddy, and Brooks introduced the concept of the
Anomalous State of Knowledge, or ASK. This was a very important
theoretical model because it framed retrieval as a process of resolving
a gap in the user’s knowledge, not just matching keywords.

Around the same period, from 1982 to 1988, the OKAPI model was
developed. This was a probabilistic retrieval model that produced ranked
outputs based on an inverted index. It laid the groundwork for what
later became BM25, still one of the most widely used ranking functions
today.

A major turning point came in 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee, working at
CERN, proposed the World Wide Web. This changed the context of IR
completely, shifting from specialized databases to a global, open
information space.

In 1992, the TREC conference was launched as part of the TIPSTER text
program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and NIST. TREC
provided standardized test collections and evaluation frameworks, which
accelerated research and allowed fair comparisons between different
retrieval methods.

    NG, and Michael Jordan in 2003
:::
:::::

::: notes
Several key developments mark the evolution of modern information
retrieval systems. Some of the selected ones are as follows:

In 1996, at Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed
the PageRank algorithm, a seminal contribution that ranked web pages
based on link structure rather than just keyword frequency. This
innovation became the foundation of Google’s search engine and
transformed large-scale web retrieval.

Latent Semantic Indexing, or LSI, gained significant popularity with the
growth of the World Wide Web. The method, originally introduced in the
late 1980s, was designed to capture hidden semantic structures in text
by reducing dimensionality through singular value decomposition. In the
context of the web, LSI was quickly adopted in Search Engine
Optimization (SEO) practices. The reasoning was that by modeling the
semantic relationships among terms, web pages could be optimized not
only for exact keywords, but also for related concepts and variations.
This marked an early move from simple keyword matching toward a more
semantically aware retrieval process.

Although later models like probabilistic topic models and neural
embeddings surpassed LSI in accuracy and scalability, its role was
historically important -- it bridged the gap between traditional
keyword-based retrieval and more advanced semantic methods.

In 2003, David Blei, Andrew Ng, and Michael Jordan introduced Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a probabilistic generative model that
enabled documents to be represented as mixtures of latent topics. LDA
marked an important theoretical and practical advance in modeling text
corpora and topic-driven retrieval.

By 2005, Google introduced personalized search, adapting retrieval
results to individual user histories and profiles. This was a shift from
universal rankings toward user-centered retrieval models.

In 2010, the field saw the integration of multimedia information
retrieval, with researchers such as Smeulders, Lew, and Sebe working on
retrieval methods for images, video, and audio. This expanded the scope
of IR beyond text into multimodal domains.

The years 2013–2014 introduced the first widely adopted semantic models,
particularly Word2Vec (Mikolov et al.) and GloVe (Pennington, Socher,
Manning). These embedding models captured semantic relationships in
continuous vector spaces and significantly improved retrieval quality.

In 2018, Google introduced BERT (Devlin, Chang, Lee, Toutanova), a deep
contextual language model that revolutionized semantic search and
natural language understanding within IR systems.

By 2020–2021, conversational IR emerged in mainstream use, integrated
into voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant,
enabling multi-turn, interactive retrieval.

Most recently, in 2022–2023, the rise of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has combined neural retrieval with large language models, enabling
systems not only to retrieve relevant documents but also to generate
coherent, contextually enriched answers. This represents the convergence
of IR with generative AI, defining the current frontier of the field.

## Who are the Users?

> A user is a person who uses information and/or information systems in
> some meaningful way

A user can be:

-   End-user: seeks, evaluates, uses information for personal question
    or problem
-   System-user: end user who exploits information systems at some level
-   Information professional: facilitates end-user information seeking
    and use
-   Computerized system, software program

::: notes
Everyone is an information user and exploits information systems at some
level. The literature uses many terms to describe users, such as end
users, system users, and information professionals. They are all users
of IR systems, right? End users and system users are basically the same.
The term end user comes from a time in libraries when users could not
access the library catalog and the librarian conducted the searching for
them in a closed stack environment. When libraries became automated in
the 1970s and 80s the term system users began being used to describe
both the end users but also the information professionals who now had
access to online resources using dumb terminals (not connected to an
external server) and to a small set of subject specific databases. Your
readings provide you will more of this history.

Computerized systems like bots on the web are also users of our systems,
right? The bots access our OPACs to index our collections and make them
accessible through search engines.
:::

## User's Information Needs

Users are motivated to seek information in a given situation to:

-   answer a question
-   solve a problem
-   complete a task
-   learn about a subject
-   verify a fact
-   just for fun

::: notes
Whether you are a system designer, reference librarian, or just want to
become a better searcher, it is important to understand more about WHY
and HOW people search for information. Information scientists have long
studied what is called Information Behavior (how people find and use
information to various purposes) and a subset of information behavior
called information seeking, which focuses on the process, tools, and
decisions associated with seeking for information.

Generally we know that users are motivated to seek information as part
of a situational context to answer a question, solve a problem, complete
a task, to learn more or verify a fact. What we know less about is how
they seek information for fun or entertainment. There are some very
interesting studies about information seeking for hobbyists, within
social media, or just to surf for fun. But we need to learn more.
:::

## User's Information Needs

Typical user questions:

-   What
-   When
-   Where
-   Why
-   How

::: notes
When helping users search or use different IR systems we can expect
specific kinds of questions, such as WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY and HOW.
Drawing out a user’s actual information need, however, is often
challenging as they may not know how to ask the question, how to enter a
query into the system, or to use the functions of the system to find
what they are looking for. In libraries, we conduct “reference
interviews” but in other contexts the conversation you have with users,
or that users have with a computer, is designed to extract more
information about their information need, right?

Later in the course, we will talk more about how to refine an
information need to conform with system parameters.
:::

## Information Needs

Two broad categories of searches:

-   Known item search
-   Subject or topic search

::: notes
Research has also shown that there are two broad categories of searches
that users conduct:

1.  Known item searches – where the user knows something about the item
    they are seeking such as title or author

2.  Subject or topic searches – the user knows some aspect of the
    subject or topic that they need to learn more about or that they
    need to find specific information about.

This is not quite as simple as it sounds. Very often a user will not
know how to express their precise information need or how to implement
it within a given system. They also may not remember correctly the
author or title they think they know. In modern systems depending on the
IR technique of the system or its capabilities to match partial search
information, the user can still find useful information. We will talk
more about this topic throughout the semester.

![](images/clipboard-1371401673.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
In this class, we will also learn more specifics about the IR process
and IR systems. As this slide notes, IR systems are specialized systems
that are used for the description, storage and retrieval of information
representations (or the information objects). These objects can take
many forms.

Users access the records of the objects or the objects by matching
search terms or queries to data or representations about the objects
within the system. IR systems are set up to use algorithms that provide
the “matching” function. Older systems primarily were exact match
systems, meaning that the query terms and terms in the representation
and/or inverted index had to match exactly.

The most significant change in IR systems is that MOST are no longer
exact match systems but will match on part of the query terms.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are also changing
expectations of users and how they think search engines and databases to
work.
:::

## Components of IR systems

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Knowledge system into which an IR system is implanted generally consists
of three main components:

a)  [people in their role as
    information-processors]{style="color: blue;"}

b)  [documents in their role as carriers of
    information]{style="color: blue;"}

c)  [topics as representations]{style="color: blue;"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/2.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}
:::
:::::

::: notes
Let us now consider the basic conceptual framework of information
retrieval systems.

An IR system is not an isolated tool, but rather one that is implanted
within a broader knowledge system.

This system can be thought of as consisting of three interrelated
components:

1.  People, in their role as information processors and seekers of
    knowledge.

2.  Documents, in their role as carriers and representations of
    information.

3.  Topics, which function as abstract representations of knowledge
    domains and link users to the documents they seek.

This slide illustrates a “basic” model of how IR works. On the left side
are the documents and representations that are stored by the system. On
the right side are the user interactions with the system. The center
section shows the matching function and the output or results of the
search. Of course in a computer there is much more to it, but this gives
us the basic idea of how IR works.

As Lancaster observed, the purpose of an IR system is not to directly
inform the user on the subject of their inquiry. Instead, its role is
more precise: to inform the user of the existence, non-existence, and
whereabouts of documents relevant to their request. In its early
conception, therefore, IR was fundamentally about retrieval of
documents, not retrieval of information.

This notion shifted significantly with the advent of full-text
availability in bibliographic databases. No longer constrained to
indexes and metadata, IR systems could now operate directly on the
content of documents. Originally, IR meant text retrieval systems,
reflecting the textual nature of the collections.

However, modern IR systems increasingly handle multimedia information —
not only text, but also images, audio, and video. This transition has
required the development of new tools, methods, and techniques capable
of supporting retrieval across multiple modalities. It represents one of
the major conceptual and technological expansions in the field.
:::

## Model of IR System

![](images/3.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
The Chowdhury reading, Chapter 1, provides a much more complete picture,
expanding each of the functions of the Blair model on the last slide.
The actors of each side are also included, such as on the left side,
they include content creators, producers of the documents but also the
catalogers who provide the descriptions or the metadata associated with
each object.

This slide also shows a range of types of documents that might be
accessible in a system. Chowdhury’s model also shows the outcomes of the
representation process, by the human indexer as well as the computer
processing the representations or documents, as well as the standards
and tools that are used in the representation process.

In the middle is the search interface and IR technique that provide the
matching function. On the right are the users within a societal context,
which affects what they know and what types of knowledge they bring when
they use an IR system.

At the bottom of this model are other factors, such as national,
technological, etc. that affect the context in which an IR system
exists. This is one of my favorite models for understanding the
complexity of an IR system because it incorporates contextual factors
into the model which have direct influence on the IR system and how it
is used.

We will learn more about IR systems, models and how to evaluate IR
systems in the later modules.

## Scope of IR System

-   IRS and database systems merely find what already is there. It does
    not invent anything new by itself

-   Whatever is there and whatever is already represented in a form, IR
    system can retrieve it

:::::

::: notes
Now that we’ve looked at the definition and scope of Information
Retrieval, let’s consider the different categories of services that IR
supports.

On the left, we see types that focus on **context and users**:

**Web Search**, the most familiar to all of us, where IR powers
large-scale search engines across the open internet.

**Personalized IR**, which adapts results to individual user preferences
and past behaviors.

**Enterprise or Institutional IR**, which focuses on retrieving
information within organizations — for example, searching across company
documents or academic repositories.

And **Domain-Specific IR**, which is specialized for a particular field
such as medicine, law, or engineering, where terminology and relevance
criteria are unique.

On the right, we have **system-based services**:

**Web-Based IR Systems**, which deliver retrieval through online
interfaces.

**Digital Libraries**, which apply IR to structured, curated collections
of academic and cultural material.

**Multimedia IR Systems**, which extend beyond text to include images,
audio, and video retrieval.

And finally, **Distributed IR Systems**, which work across multiple,
separate data sources — for example, federated search across libraries,
or even across multiple company systems.

The important takeaway here is that IR isn’t one-size-fits-all.
Different contexts whether public web search, personalized
recommendation, or specialized domains, demand different architectures
and retrieval strategies.

## What Information Can You Find Online?

-   Bibliographic citations
-   Full-text documents
-   Directory of reference sources
-   Numeric data
-   Images
-   Multimedia files

::: notes
Not to be flippant, but did you laugh the first time you heard someone
say that you can find everything online?

It is very common misconception of users that they can access everything
online. While the availability of content and what you can find online
has definitely improved, not everything can be found online.

What is also key to remember is that you need to know which systems hold
specific types of information, so you choose an appropriate system.

For example, if you are looking for a book to purchase you might use the
Web and Amazon or Barnes and Noble. If you just want to borrow a book
you would search for it in the library catalog and may find it easily
accessible or the library may have to order it for you. (As I type this
I realize this has also changed. With Amazon services you can now rent
books and return them.)

To locate scholarly articles, like those usually required for research
papers in your classes, you would use OU Libraries subject/discipline
specific databases.

You can, in some instances, use Google Scholar, but often you end up
with a citation that requires payment to access the actual article. AND
Google Scholar is not as heavily indexed so you may miss relevant
articles if you use different terms than what is in the Google Scholar
index.

The point here is that choosing the correct system is critical in
finding the useful information you need. We will talk about this more
later in the course.

## Issues to Consider

How is access to the Internet changing our user's ................?

-   Expectations

-   Ways of engaging with information

-   Brains

-   Information needs/seeking activities and behaviors

-   Other thoughts?

::: notes
Other issues to consider that we will explore together are, for example,

1.  How have users expectations changed now that almost ubiquitous
    access to the Web is possible?
2.  Has our way of engaging with information also changed?
3.  Is there any effect on our brains due to the way we interact with
    online systems today?
4.  Are there new sets of information behaviors that information
    professionals need to take into account? For example, how have using
    smart phones affected IR?
5.  Other thoughts?

We will explore these issues and others together.

# Putting It All Together

::: notes
This class focuses on all aspects of IR from understanding more about
users and their information needs, to system structures and IR
techniques, to how to capitalize on these understandings to improve your
own search abilities. It is also important to understand your own search
process and where you might need to improve. This semester provides you
will the opportunity to play with many different systems and to test out
their features as you become a more proficient searcher and as you learn
more about how IR works. My hope is that you enjoy the entire process!!
