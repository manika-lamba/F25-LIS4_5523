# Why Search Strategy is Important?

::: notes
You probably think you're pretty good at searching online, right? I
mean, we all do it every day. But, you know, there's a huge difference
between just typing a few words into Google and actually having the
power to find the exact thing you need right when you need it. As you
know we live in an era of infodemic. In this absolute avalanche of
information, how can you find that one valuable piece of information in
all of that deafening noise?

This and next week, we’ll delve into various search techniques and
strategies to enhance your searching skills in both search engines and
databases. Ultimately, these strategies will empower you to find the
information you seek.
:::

## Before you Start Searching

`Focusing your Question`

-   What am I looking for exactly? Question before you search!
-   Test search to find out how much information is available
    -   If you are finding little information - broaden the question
    -   If you are finding lots of information - narrow the question

`Define Your Need`

-   How much information do I need?
-   What kind of information do I need?

::: notes
When starting any project, the first and most important step is to focus
your question. Before you even begin searching, take a moment to ask
yourself, “What exactly am I looking for?” Defining your question early
helps guide your search and keeps you from getting lost in the huge
amount of information that’s out there. A good strategy is to start with
a test search. This means doing a quick preliminary search to see how
much information is available on your topic. If you’re finding very
little, that’s a sign your question might be too narrow, and you’ll need
to broaden it. On the other hand, if you’re finding too much
information, your question is probably too broad, and you should narrow
your focus to make it more manageable. The goal is to find a question
that’s specific enough to give direction but not so limited that you
can’t find enough material.

Once you’ve focused your question, the next step is to define your need.
Ask yourself, “How much information do I actually need?” and “What kind
of information am I looking for?” Depending on your assignment or
project, you might need just a few key facts, or you might need
detailed, scholarly research. Think about whether you need background
information, data, case studies, or peer-reviewed articles. Being clear
about your information needs will save you time and help you select the
right sources later on. By carefully focusing your question and defining
your needs, you’ll set a strong foundation for an efficient and
successful research process.
:::

## Developing a Search Strategy

![](images/2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
The slide shows you a ten step process for developing a search strategy
to find the right information efficiently and effectively -- beginning
with defining your question and ending with applying what you’ve
learned. Each step helps you refine your focus, improve the quality of
your search results, and ensure that the information you gather is
credible and useful.

The first step is to `ask`. Start by turning your topic into a question
to focus your search. For example, instead of just saying “climate
change,” you might ask, “What are the main causes of climate change in
urban areas?” At this stage, you should also ask yourself if your
question is too broad or too narrow. A clear, focused question sets the
direction for everything that follows.

Next, you move to `define your need`. Here, you think about what sort of
information you’re looking for and how much detail you’ll need. Are you
looking for a brief overview, a scholarly analysis, or detailed data?
Knowing this helps you target the right sources and saves you from
collecting unnecessary information.

In the third step, you `identify concepts`. Break your question into its
key ideas or main concepts. For example, in the question about climate
change in urban areas, the key concepts are “climate change” and “urban
areas.” This step helps you decide which terms to focus on during your
search.

Once you’ve identified the main concepts, you move on to
`selecting terms`. This means choosing the specific words and phrases
you’ll use in your search. Think about synonyms, alternate spellings,
and related terms that authors might use. You can also use
discipline-specific thesauri or keyword lists to expand your options.
This step ensures that you don’t miss important information just because
of word choice.

The fifth step is to `select your sources`. Not all sources are created
equal, so it’s important to decide whether you’ll use primary,
secondary, or tertiary sources. Ask yourself which databases, journals,
or websites are most appropriate for your topic. Choosing the right
starting point helps you gather reliable and relevant information.

Now you’re ready to `search`. This step involves constructing your
actual search using the commands or tools provided by your chosen
system. You might use Boolean operators like “AND,” “OR,” and “NOT” to
narrow or broaden your results. The key question here is, “Am I
searching efficiently?”

After you’ve started searching, you’ll likely need to `revise`.
Searching is an iterative process, meaning you’ll refine your terms and
strategies as you go. If you’re not finding enough relevant information,
you might need to broaden your terms. If you’re finding too much, you
might need to narrow your focus. The goal is to retrieve all the
information you need without being overwhelmed.

Once you have results, it’s time to `manage` them. This includes saving,
organizing, printing, or citing the material you’ve found. You should
also think about how to access full-text versions and how you’ll use
this information later. Managing your results well makes it easier to
revisit and use them for writing or projects.

Next, you need to `evaluate` what you’ve found. Not all information is
equally reliable, so take time to determine whether your sources are
trustworthy. Check if the author is credible, if the article is
peer-reviewed, and if it’s highly cited. This step ensures that your
final work is based on solid, reputable information.

Finally, the tenth step is to `apply` what you’ve learned. Use your
findings to answer your original question. Reflect on whether you’ve
fully answered it or if more information is needed. This is where you
pull everything together and turn your research into meaningful
conclusions.

Remember that your question drives the entire search strategy. There
isn’t just one “right” way to search. It’s an ongoing, flexible process
that often requires revisiting earlier steps. Avoid relying on a single
source or a single search and instead, approach it as a cycle of
questioning, searching, evaluating, and refining to get the best
results.
:::

## Example

1.  Ask: What `health` problems are associated with `water pollution`?
2.  Main Concepts: health, water, pollution
3.  Select terms:

-   Synonyms: `health`, illness, disease, etc. `water`, rivers, lakes,
    sea, domestic water, etc. `pollution`, ‘oil spills’, chemical,
    biological, toxicity, etc
-   Plurals: river(s), lake(s), disease(s)
-   Capitals: e.g. name of a specific lake, disease, region

::: notes
In this example, you will see numerous options for this search. Some of
these options will enable you to broaden the search while others will
limit it.

## Types of Searching

| `Semantic Search`              | `Keyword Search`    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Understands intent and context | Matches exact terms |
| Interprets meaning             | Literal matching    |
| Considers synonyms             | No content analysis |
| Learns from patterns           | Fast processing     |
| Delivers relevant insights     | Precise results     |

::: notes
Semantic search in data analytics focuses on understanding the intent
behind queries rather than just matching exact words. It interprets
query context and relationships between data points to provide more
accurate insights. Unlike keyword search, which retrieves literal
matches, semantic search considers synonyms, entity relationships, and
historical patterns. For example, when querying "customer churn
prediction," semantic search identifies factors contributing to churn,
even if the exact term isn’t used in the data.

Keyword search is a method that matches the exact words or phrases you
type into a search bar. It focuses on identifying specific terms without
considering their context or your intent. This approach works well when
you know the exact words related to what you are looking for. For
example, if you search for "best coding tools for developers," keyword
search will look for pages containing those exact terms. It does not
analyze the relationships between the words or their deeper meaning.

This type of search is widely used in industries where precision is
essential. For instance, cloud-based project management software often
relies on keyword search to help users find specific tasks or documents.
Similarly, developers use keyword search to locate tools that improve
productivity, such as those offering code completion or debugging
features.
:::

## How Semantic Search Works

-   Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understands language nuances and
    context

-   Machine Learning (ML): Enhances accuracy through pattern recognition
    and user feedback

-   Knowledge Graphs: Link related data entities for enriched insights

::: notes
Semantic search employs advanced technologies like NLP and ML to process
queries effectively. For instance, in data platforms like Google
BigQuery, semantic search enables analysts to retrieve related datasets
even if the query phrasing differs. NLP helps understand query
semantics, ML refines accuracy over time, and knowledge graphs
contextualize results.

Semantic search offers several key features that set it apart from
keyword-based methods:

-   Contextual Understanding: It interprets the meaning of your query by
    considering context, synonyms, and related terms.

-   User Intent Recognition: It focuses on what you want to achieve
    rather than just the words you use.

-   Dynamic Learning: Machine learning continuously improves search
    accuracy based on user behavior.

-   Enhanced Relevance: It delivers results that align with your needs,
    even if the exact keywords aren't present.

-   Improved User Experience: By understanding natural language, it
    makes searching more intuitive and satisfying.

These features make semantic search a powerful tool for improving search
accuracy and user satisfaction. Platforms like Google and e-commerce
sites leverage these capabilities to provide better results and enhance
product discovery.
:::

## How Keyword Search Works

-   Term Breaking: Breaks queries into individual words
-   Exact Matching: Searches database for exact matches
-   No Context Analysis: Does not analyze relationships between terms

::: notes
Keyword search processes your query by breaking it into individual
terms. Each word is treated separately, and the system looks for matches
in its database. It does not try to understand the intent behind your
query. Instead, it focuses on literal matches. This can sometimes lead
to irrelevant results if the exact terms do not align with what you
mean.

For example, if you search for "Apple," the system might return results
about the fruit instead of the company, depending on the context of the
database. Unlike semantic search, keyword search does not analyze
relationships between terms or consider synonyms. It simply retrieves
results based on the words you provide.

Keyword search offers several features that make it effective in certain
scenarios:

-   Precision: It retrieves results that match your exact query, making
    it ideal for specific searches.

-   Simplicity: It is easy to use and does not require complex
    algorithms.

-   Speed: It processes queries quickly because it does not analyze
    context or intent.

Wide Application: It works well in industries like software development
and project management, where users often search for specific terms.

However, keyword search has limitations. It lacks the ability to
understand your intent or the context of your query. This can result in
irrelevant results, especially for complex or ambiguous searches.
Despite these drawbacks, keyword search remains a valuable tool for
straightforward queries where precision matters most.

## Selecting a Source

![](images/4.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
It’s important to understand that not all information sources are the
same. They can generally be grouped into three categories -- primary,
secondary, and tertiary sources -- based on how close they are to the
original research or information. No single type of source gives you
everything you need, so an effective search strategy often involves
using a combination of all three.

Let’s start with primary sources. These are the original materials that
present first-hand evidence or direct results of research. Examples
include conference papers, journal articles reporting original studies,
case reports, dissertations, and clinical trial protocols. When you read
a primary source, you’re getting information straight from the
researcher -- it hasn’t yet been interpreted or summarized by someone
else.

Next, we have secondary sources. These take primary research and
interpret, analyze, or summarize it. They’re one step removed from the
original work. Examples include review articles, bibliographies,
abstracting and indexing services like PubMed, and meta-analyses.
Secondary sources are especially useful when you want to understand
trends, compare findings, or get an overview of research on a specific
topic without reading every individual study.

Finally, there are tertiary sources, which provide summaries or
collections of general information that are often compiled from both
primary and secondary sources. These include encyclopedias,
dictionaries, reference books, and textbooks. Tertiary sources are a
great starting point for background information when you’re first
learning about a topic or clarifying key concepts.

The arrow at the bottom of the slide, represents how we often move
between these three types of sources during research. We might start
with tertiary sources to get a broad understanding, move on to secondary
sources for analysis and summaries, and then go to primary sources to
look at the original evidence in detail. Understanding how these
different sources fit together helps you locate, evaluate, and use
information more effectively in your research.
:::

## Selecting a Source (Cont.) {.smaller}

![](images/5.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
When we’re choosing information sources for research, it’s important to
understand that each type — tertiary, secondary, and primary — comes
with its own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing these helps us decide
which source to use depending on what stage of research we’re in and
what kind of information we need.

Let’s start with tertiary sources. These include things like
encyclopedias, dictionaries, and textbooks. The big advantage of
tertiary sources is that they’re easy to access and use, they provide
concise summaries, and they’re often relatively inexpensive. They’re
great when you need a quick overview or background on a topic. However,
their main disadvantages are that there’s often a lag time — meaning the
information may not be up to date — and they can sometimes be outdated,
incomplete, or even incorrectly interpreted. Because tertiary sources
summarize other materials, they can lose detail and accuracy along the
way.

Next, we have secondary sources. These are tools that help us locate and
interpret primary research, such as databases, bibliographies, and
review articles. Their main advantages are that they offer rapid access
to primary literature, are usually found in high-standard journals, and
allow for complex searches. Many databases also provide routine updates
or alerts, which help keep your information current. On the downside,
secondary sources also experience some lag time between when research is
done and when it’s indexed. In addition, search commands and interfaces
vary between systems, so using them effectively requires strong search
skills. Finally, some of these databases or journals can be expensive to
access, especially outside of academic institutions.

Finally, we come to primary sources, which are the most original form of
information — things like journal articles reporting new research, case
studies, and dissertations. The biggest advantages of primary sources
are that they provide original data and unbiased information, meaning
you get the research straight from the source. However, these sources
can also be time-consuming to read and analyze, and the sheer volume of
data can be overwhelming, especially if you’re not familiar with the
topic.

Each type of source serves a unique purpose: tertiary sources are great
for background, secondary sources help locate and interpret information,
and primary sources provide the raw data. The key is to know when and
how to use each effectively to support your research goals.

## Which Search Tools are Needed? {.smaller}

-   Gateways
    -   node or network that serves as an entrance to another network
    -   organize information in a structured way in general or subject
        categories
    -   Examples: WHO A-Z health topics list (www.who.int/topics/en/),
        Essential Health Links (www.healthnet.org/essential-links/)\
-   Databases
    -   collection of information organized in such a way that a
        computer can quickly select desired pieces of data\
    -   electronic filing system\
    -   traditional databases are organized by fields, records and files
    -   Example: PubMed, ProQuest
-   Search Engines
    -   program that searches documents for specified keywords and
        returns a list of documents where the keywords were found
    -   on the WWW, utilizes automated robotics to gather and index
        information
    -   Examples: Google, Internet Explorer

::: notes
There are four major tools for finding information on the web:

-   Browsers
-   Directories
-   Search Engines
-   Meta Search Engines
-   Invisible Web or Deep Web

Generally, a gateway is a webpage designed to attract visitors and
search engines to a particular website on a specific topic(s). Often
used interchangeably with the term gateway, a web portal is mega website
or service providing search engines, e-mail, chat rooms, forums, etc as
it attempts to provide multiple functions via a single web page or site.
When you leave OU library webpage and access a Partner Publisher’s
website, you are going from a gateway to a publisher’s portal.

In a search engine, there is no criteria for selection like in a
gateway. A search engine consists of three parts:

-   Spider or Crawler: a computer program that crawls through the web
    from link to link identifying and reading pages.
-   Index: a database that contains a copy of each web page gathered by
    the crawler.
-   Search engine mechanism: software that allows search and retrieval
    of information that usually returns the results in some ranked order
    based on relevance.
:::

## Google's Search Operators

Special commands and characters that extend the capabilities of standard
text searches

1.  Phrase Search ("...") finds the exact phrase
    -   Example: "climate change"
2.  Site (:) searches for content on a specific domain
    -   Example: site:wikipedia.org "climate change"
3.  Filetype (:) limits results to specific file types
    -   Example: "early retirement" filetype:pdf

::: notes
So, what are these search operators? You can think of them like special
instructions, or maybe even cheat codes, that you give directly to the
search engine. Instead of just handing it a bunch of keywords, you're
telling it exactly how to search, forcing it to be way more specific.

First and the most important one, is using quotation marks for a
`phrase` search. So, if you just type in climate change, Google looks
for pages that have those two words on them somewhere. But if you put it
in quotes, it will only show you results where those two words appear
together in that exact order. This one trick alone will make your
results so much better.

Next is the `site` operator. It tells Google to only look for results
within one specific website. So, let's say you really trust a source,
like Wikipedia for some background, or maybe a government site for
official data. You can use this to completely ignore the rest of the
internet and just search that one single place.

The last one is `filetype` operator. This lets you hunt for specific
kinds of documents. So, if you are looking for say an official report or
journal article, use filetype pdf. But if you want to find a
presentation, use filetype ppt. It's an amazing way to cut through all
the blog posts and find those primary documents.
:::

## Database Searching {.smaller}

1.  Boolean Logic (AND, OR, NOT): Use operators like AND, OR, and NOT to
    define relationships between search terms
2.  Truncation/Wildcards (\*): Finds variations of a word. Ex: therap\*
3.  Alternate Spellings (?): Finds alternate spellings. Ex: behavio?r
4.  Phrase ("...") or Proximity (...): Search for exact phrase. Ex:
    "information literacy", prevention and (malaria parasite)

{{< video https://youtu.be/x-OaX6bq-Rs?si=kU9lEBGp-16e0S9i width="700" height="300">}}

::: notes
So when you want to query a massive complex database instead of
searching for a casual question, you need to know the language that all
databases speak, it's called Boolean logic.

We have already discussed Boolean operators by now. But to give you a
quick recap, it is a simple way to combine your keywords using three
little magic words: "and," "or," and "not":

-   Think of "and" like a filter as it narrows your search, because any
    result has to contain both of your terms
-   "Or" is like casting a wider net. It'll find results that have
    either one of your terms, which is great for synonyms
-   "Not" is like a bouncer at a club. It just kicks out any results
    that have a word you don't want to see

If you are interested to learn more about it, watch the video on the
slide on "Smooth Operator" by OU Libraries.

Next is Truncation or Wildcard where you use an asterisk to find all the
different versions of a word's root. In contrast, you can use question
mark to catch words with different spellings.

Finally, you can use quotation marks and brackets to search for exact
phrases.
:::

## Keyword vs. Subject Search {.smaller}

![](images/3.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

| Keyword Search | Subject Search |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Searches for exact words entered | Searches with pre-defined vocabulary |
| You can enter your own terms | You need to know the exact controlled term |
| Database looks for keywords anywhere | Database looks only in the subject field |
| Yields too many or too few results. Many irrelevant. | Yields more specific results most of which are relevant |

::: notes
When you begin searching in a database, it’s important to understand the
difference between a keyword search and a subject search, because the
type of search you choose can really affect your results. A keyword
search looks for the exact words you type anywhere in the record -- this
could include the title, abstract, or even the full text. It’s flexible
because you can enter your own terms, but it can also be inconsistent.
For example, if you search using keywords, the database doesn’t
understand the meaning behind the words -- it simply matches what you’ve
typed. This often results in too many or too few results, and sometimes
many of them are irrelevant.

In contrast, a subject search uses a pre-defined or controlled
vocabulary created by the database, often called subject headings or
descriptors. This means the database has already categorized items under
specific, standardized terms. To do a subject search, you need to know
the exact term used in that system, but once you do, your results are
usually much more precise and relevant. Subject searches tend to filter
out unrelated material and focus only on sources that truly deal with
your topic.

Keyword searches are great when you’re starting out and exploring a
topic, but once you know the correct subject terms, using a subject
search can give you higher-quality, more focused results.
:::

## Social Media Searching {.smaller}

1.  Hashtags Search (#)

2.  Keyword search

3.  User/Account Search

4.  Location Based Search

5.  Trend/Topic Search

6.  Advanced Filters

7.  Sound/Music Search

8.  Explore/Discover Pages

9.  Mention/Reply Search

10. Saved/Bookmarked Search

::: notes
Finally, lets talk about social media searching.

When we think about searching on social media, it’s important to realize
that there are many different ways to discover content and each method
serves a unique purpose. Let’s walk through the main ones.

First, we have **hashtag search**, which is perhaps the most versatile
and universal method across platforms. When you search by a hashtag, you
can see all posts tagged with that specific keyword — for example,
**#TravelPhotography**, **#FitnessMotivation**, or **#CodingTips**. This
is especially useful for finding communities or trends centered around
particular interests.

Next is **keyword search**, which is a more general search method. Here,
you’re typing plain text words rather than hashtags like *“best coffee
shops”* or *“Python tutorial.”* This type of search looks through
captions, titles, descriptions, and even comments to match your
keywords. It’s great for discovering content where users might not have
used hashtags.

Then there’s **user or account search**, which allows you to look up
specific people, creators, or brands. For example, you could search
@elonmusk or *“Taylor Swift”* to find their official profiles.

We also have **location-based search**, where you can search by a city,
venue, or specific place — such as *“Eiffel Tower”* or *“Central Park.”*
This is useful for finding posts geotagged at that location, and it’s
commonly used on platforms like Instagram.

Another key method is **trend or topic search**. This is how users
explore what’s currently viral — trending challenges, hashtags, or
sounds.

Then we have **advanced filters**, which allow you to narrow your search
by date, engagement level, media type, language, or verified status. For
example, Twitter lets you filter between “latest” and “top” tweets,
YouTube can filter by upload date, and Instagram can sort by engagement.
These filters are powerful tools for refining your results.

Platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels also offer **sound or music
search**. You can search by song name or audio clip to find all videos
that use that track — and by clicking *“Use This Sound,”* you can see
every related post.

Next, there are **Explore or Discovery pages**, which are
algorithm-driven rather than search-driven. These pages curate content
based on your viewing history and engagement. Examples include
Instagram’s Explore page, TikTok’s *For You Page (FYP)*, and YouTube’s
recommendations feed.

Another layer of search is **mention or reply search**, where you can
explore comments, replies, and mentions to track conversations about a
particular topic or user. This is common on platforms like Twitter,
where you can see threads of replies and @mentions related to a post or
account.

And finally, we have **saved or bookmarked searches**, which allow you
to revisit previous searches, saved posts, or watchlists quickly. This
helps you keep track of content you want to come back to later — whether
that’s a tutorial, an idea, or a conversation thread.

So, social media search isn’t just about typing in a word or hashtag —
it’s a combination of tools, filters, and algorithms that together shape
how we discover information, people, and trends online.

## How Social Media Searching Works?

-   Indexing: Platforms scan and catalog all posts, photos, and profiles
-   Matching: Your search query is matched against the massive index
-   Ranking: Results are ranked by relevance, popularity, and recency
-   Personalization: Results are customized based on your history and
    behavior
-   Delivery: Top results appear instantly on your screen

::: notes
When we examine how social media searching works, it helps to break the process down into five key steps. 

The first step is **indexing**. In this stage, the platform scans and catalogs all posts, photos, videos, hashtags, profiles, and other content. This creates a massive, organized database that can be quickly searched. 

Next is **matching**. When you enter a search query, whether it’s a hashtag, keyword, or username, the system compares it against its index to find all relevant content. 

Once matching content is identified, the platform moves to **ranking**. Here, results are sorted based on factors like relevance, popularity, and recency — for instance, newer or highly engaged posts are likely to appear higher in your results. 

The fourth step is **personalization**. Social media platforms tailor the search results to you, taking into account your history, behavior, location, and the accounts you interact with, so two people searching the same term may see different results. 

Finally, there’s **delivery**, where the top-ranked and personalized results are presented instantly on your screen. This process happens within milliseconds, giving the appearance of real-time discovery, but it’s actually the result of a highly complex and efficient system working behind the scenes.
