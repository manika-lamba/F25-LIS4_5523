<p>This week, we are going to talk about information retrieval (IR) from different perspectives. First, we will look at some different information retrieval models that are present in today’s systems, as well as look at some of those in earlier systems.

<p>IR has been defined very basically as a process in which sets of records or documents are searched to find items, which may help to satisfy the user’s information needs.</p>
<p>Now, we know from our discussions throughout class that IR is a lot more complicated than has been defined here.</p>
<p>IR is concerned with several different processes as well as how the system is structured. It’s concerned with</p>
<ul>
<li>representation from both a user’s side, or</li>
<li>how the user represents their need within a system mechanism, and from the computerized side, or</li>
<li>from the system’s side of how items in the collection are represented within the system,</li>
<li>how the system is set up and structured, and</li>
<li>how the cataloger or indexer has represented those objects within that system structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>IR is also concerned with storage of the representations from the system side (and how the system is structured) and the organization of those representations, meaning how the field structure is devised, the system search algorithms, and the different IR models in use to access the information objects successfully.</p>

<img data-src="images/blair.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch"><aside class="notes">
<p>This slide illustrates a “basic” model of how IR works. On the left side are the documents and representations that are stored by the system. On the right side are the user interactions with the system. The center section shows the matching function and the output or results of the search. Of course in a computer there is much more to it, but this gives us the basic idea of how IR works.</p>

<p>The Chowdhury reading, Chapter 1, provides a much more complete picture, expanding each of the functions of the Blair model on the last slide. The actors of each side are also included, such as on the left side, they include content creators, producers of the documents but also the catalogers who provide the descriptions or the metadata associated with each object.</p>
<p>This side also shows a range of types of documents that might be accessible in a system. Chowdhury’s model also shows the outcomes of the representation process, by the human indexer as well as the computer processing the representations or documents, as well as the standards and tools that are used in the representation process.</p>
<p>In the middle is the search interface and IR technique that provide the matching function. On the right are the users within a societal context, which affects what they know and what types of knowledge they bring when they use an IR system.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this model are other factors, such as national, technological, etc. that affect the context in which an IR system exists. This is one of my favorite models for understanding the complexity of an IR system because it incorporates contextual factors into the model which have direct influence on the IR system and how it is used.</p>

<h2>Model of Information Retrieval</h2>

<img data-src="images/1.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch" style="width:80.0%"><aside class="notes">
<p>Another way to think about IR is to see it as a process in which multiple representations interact within an IR system to connect users to information.</p>
<p>Representation A is the user’s information need, which the user enters into a system using terms that they believe represent this need.</p>
<p>Representation B is the representation created as a surrogate for the information object by a cataloger or indexer. Often the cataloger will use a set of authorized terms, called a controlled vocabulary to represent the subjects, but also a set of standards that tell them how to describe the object within the representation.</p>
<p>Both are entered into a system.</p>
<p>The retrieval component of the information system matches these two representations and brings back a subset of representations that the system contains that are representative of the words in the users queries. (We won’t go into the mechanics of searching at this point, or how the retrieval mechanisms work within various systems.)</p>
<p>The user then chooses a representation to review to see if it meets their information need or not.</p>

<p>IR concerns a wide range of concepts. In Module 3.1 we talked about users, what we have learned about users in our research, and what we can learn about users – related to their types and levels of knowledge – as well as the different variables the come into play that are related to context and the information environment in which they’re conducting their searches. We also talked about different information needs and information sources.</p>
<p>We’re going to focus this time more about the <strong>information system</strong>. We are going to look at the system capabilities and the IR techniques or models being used, as well as how that impacts how information is organized and retrieved.

<p>The central problem of IR then is how to represent documents for retrieval. Our field has done a lot of research on users and their information behavior, as we talked about in Module 3.1.

<p>To be more successful, we’ve found in our research, document representation must be similar to the way that ordinary language is used, which, again, presents some problems.</p>
<p>We’ll talk later in this lecture about the natural language processing model of IR and some of the issues associated with that.</p>

<h2>Information Retrieval (Cont.)</h2>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>IR and the models that we’ll cover in this lecture, both the classical and the more advanced models being developed and being used today, were introduced in the 1960’s. The retrieval within those models was and still remains primarily textual based. What I mean by ‘textual based’ is that the systems were being designed primarily to retrieve text - based documents within sets of different document collections using text - based representations.</p>
<p>IR systems also make use of inverted indexes and index terms, especially within our online databases. Even search engines have inverted indexes as the basis for retrieval.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that information retrieval is no longer just a library problem. People do not just retrieve documents within library systems any longer; IR is used in multiple different contexts as well as in everyday homes. People are using the web, and the penetration of web access within the home environment is pretty high within the United States, though it does vary. There are definitely digital divide issues; however, users can also access the web for everyday use in libraries and other organizations, and of course, using smart phones and other devices. And around the world we know that access to the web is also at varying levels.</p>
<p>As a result of these more evolved uses – we’re no longer just using databases to do research – users have very high standards of retrieval and of our retrieval systems. And oftentimes they come away from a library OPAC being very unsatisfied with the results. Some of these expectations can be attributed to the system, but also to the user’s misunderstandings about how that particular system functions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy of IR Techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>We can divide IR techniques into basic classes</code>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exact Match</strong>: <em>where the set of retrieved documents contains only documents whose representations match exactly with the query</em></li>
<li><strong>Partial Match</strong>: <em>where there is some matching that occurs, but it is not exact, although some of the documents may be exact matches to the query</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>At the heart, we can divide information retrieval techniques into two basic classes: <strong>exact match</strong> and <strong>partial match</strong>. Systems today still have these techniques in place.</p>
<p>Exact match is where the set of retrieved documents, contains <em>only</em> documents whose representations – those of the indexer within the system and those of the user in their search queries – <em>match</em> exactly when an IR transaction is taking place.</p>
<p>For example, in an exact match system, if I put in the terms, ‘information’ and ‘data,’ my system documents are only going to retrieve those items that include ‘information’ and ‘data,’ and they will leave out any other types of materials that might be related even though they could be potential matches.</p>
<p>In a partial match model, this is where some matching occurs, the terms are not necessarily exactly the same , some of the documents may be exact matches to the query, but then others might be what we considered ‘partial’ or ‘low relevance matching.’ Both of these two techniques are still present in systems today.</p>

<h2>Traditional IR Model</h2>
<h4 id="simple-match-model"><strong><code>Simple Match Model</code></strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Request = Information Data</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Document A = data, information</p>
<p>Document B = data, information</p>
<p>Document C = information, retrieval</p>
<p><code>Advantages</code>: simple process; widespread; familiar</p>
<p><code>Disadvantages</code>: single descriptor requests less effective in large databases</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>One of the classical IR models is the <em>‘simple match model’</em> or a <em>‘best match model’</em> that is part of an IR model.</p>
<p>For example, the user has a request, which is the information that’s needed, and that matches to the documents in our collection. So, again if we use that same example of ‘data’ and ‘information,’ if document A and document B have some reference to ‘data’ and ‘information’ within that system’s representation, within their index record, or within their bibliographic record, then we’re going to have a successful match.</p>
<p>The problem with simple match models is that it usually uses only a few query terms which becomes less effective in large databases.</p>
<p>The advantage is that it’s a simple process; it’s very wide spread and familiar to our users. They enter terms into a search engine or into a fielded search in a database, and they get back results.</p>
<p>But as I said, it becomes even less effective in larger databases where we’re searching multiple collections with thousands of documents within the collections.</p>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>One of the most <em>prevalent</em> classical IR models is what’s called ‘Boolean retrieval,’ which is one step above the basic model that I just described.</p>
<p>Boolean retrieval is present in most systems today that you’ve used, from library OPACs, to databases, to search engines. ‘Boolean’ was named for its creator, George Boole,when he developed Boolean algebra around 1850.</p>
<p>As I noted, it’s probably the most familiar IR technique, but it’s also one of the least understood techniques because the user has to manipulate the query in some way, where other techniques might work behind the interface and the user doesn’t have as much control over how the query is processed by the system, but they also don’t know what the system is doing.</p>
<p>Boolean uses the AND, OR, or NOT operators to allow more complex queries within the system. A user can structure queries in many different ways, and systems may also process Boolean operators in a different order, meaning that those search operators of AND, OR, or NOT are treated in a specific order within that system.</p>
<p>We’ll talk more about operator order and Boolean searching in the next lecture (Module 3.3) when we look at specific search structures and creating good search strings within IR systems.</p>
<p>Boolean also works with what is called ‘set theory,’ which is a binary approach – an item either belongs to a set or it doesn’t belong to a set. This is both an advantage and a limitation of the IR model.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Okay, so let’s talk about each of these operators. The OR operator is what we use to build up or combine concepts or concept blocks. We use OR when we string together synonymous terms, or what we might call equivalent terms. It’s also where we can put in spelling variants if truncation is not possible in the system or if wildcards are not possible. You also use the OR operator to put together related terms. So, again, what you’re doing with the OR operator is you’re building up those relationships between the different concepts, the synonyms or equivalent terms, spelling variants, and related terms.</p>

<p>How it works in the system–and this is something that confuses our users–is that when you use OR, any documents that contain any of the terms you’ve put together with the OR are going to be brought together in your search set, in your result set.</p>
<p>So, generally when you use OR, it produces larger sets and more documents. Okay, so you’ve got a set for ‘information seeking OR searching.’</p>
<p>So, every document in your system that has any of those terms–‘information,’ ‘seeking,’ ‘information seeking’ or ‘searching’–are going to come back into this large document set. Now what does that say about precision and recall?</p>

<p>The operator AND works very differently. AND is where we combine those concepts blocks or the words that we’re using in our queries. And it will only bring back documents that contain all of the words and all of the concept blocks. So, what the system does is to produce a smaller set, a more precise set, which includes fewer documents than our OR set includes.</p>
<p>So, if we’re looking for ‘children AND information seeking’ or ‘information, seeking,’ we’re going to find only those documents that include all of our terms, so that small set in the middle of the Venn diagram is what’s returned back to our users. Generally an AND search is going to be more precise, but it’s going to have lower recall.</p>
<p>So, if you had any documents that included ‘adults’ but did not include ‘children,’ they would not be part of the set. So, you have to think about this potential limitation to the results when you’re constructing the query.</p>

<p>Okay, the NOT operator is what we use to exclude words or concepts from our set. You want to use NOT sparingly because it may limit your search too much, okay? So, generally what you’re going to want to do is start out without using NOT, and then if you have way too many documents, that’s when you’re going to start excluding words or concepts, okay?</p>
<p>It’s only going to bring back documents that do not include those excluded terms. It produces a smaller set, even smaller than the AND set, with more specific documents–so higher precision and fewer documents, so lower recall. And, again, it depends upon the goal for the search. Do you need just really highly specific documents and few documents, or do you need to find out everything on this topic, so you want higher recall.</p>
<p>So, again, in our search ‘information seeking,’ ‘information and seeking’ and ‘NOT adults,’ we’re going to get back the white set in the middle of the diagram. But if we’re looking for documents that include both ‘adults AND children’–you know, we’re looking for information seeking of children–and we NOT out ‘adults,’ any documents that include adults and children are not going to be returned in our search. So, you need to use the NOT operator sparingly.</p>
<p>In a database, you’re going to use the NOT operator to exclude the term, in a Web search engine, you can simply insert a minus sign directly in front of the word or phrase you want to NOT out, and supposedly, it will be excluded from your document set. Or if you’re using advanced search on the Web, that’s where you can tell the search engine “do not contain these words or phrase,” and then the system should exclude the word or phrase from your set. But again, just a cautionary note, don’t start with NOT unless you’re very sure about what you want back in your document set.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of a Boolean search. We’re going to use as our search ’information AND retrieval NOT data.</p>
<p>AND in a Boolean search serves as an intersection between the terms, meaning that any documents that are retrieved have to include both ‘information’ and ‘retrieval,’ otherwise the result set will not include that particular document. The OR serves as a union, meaning that any of the two terms have to be present within the document within the OR relationship or the document would not be returned in the retrieval set.</p>
<p>The NOT serves as a complement, or we might think of it as a way of filtering out those documents that we do not want to see retrieved.</p>
<p>So, in this particular search we have ‘information AND retrieval NOT data.’ In document A, we have ‘information’ and ‘data.’ So, with the NOT serving as a complement or a filtering function, document A would not be retrieved.</p>
<p>Document B includes ‘information’ and ‘retrieval,’ which satisfies our first criteria, and ‘IR.’ Now, we don’t have the concept of IR as stated as the acronym as part of our retrieval, but because this document includes our two terms, ‘information’ and ‘retrieval,’ and it does not include the term ‘data,’ this document would be retrieved. Document C ‘information’ and ‘data’ and ‘retrieval’ would, again, not be retrieved because it includes the term ‘data.’</p>
<p>And then, in Document D ‘information’ and ‘retrieval’ and ‘book’ would be returned because it includes our terms ‘information’ AND ’retrieval.</p>

<li>May miss potentially relevant documents</li>
<li>Does not rank retrieved documents</li>

<li>So why do we continue to use them?</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>There are of course some problems with the Boolean model.</p>
<p>One of which is that you need to know the order in which those operators are processed by the system.</p>
<p>Depending upon the information retrieval system, some will use the AND operator relationship first, and then they will process the OR, followed by the NOT. Others have as first preference the OR, followed by AND, and then NOT. Depending upon how you construct your query and the order of operation, you can have some very interesting results as an impact of how the system processes those Boolean operators.</p>
<p>Also, Boolean seems very simple to users, but as you saw, there were three types of relationships that are constructed in Boolean statements, and queries can really become very complex. People also misunderstand how OR or AND function within Boolean systems.</p>
<p>A searcher may miss potentially relevant documents by using the NOT operator. If you filter out an entire set of documents based on particular terms, you’re then probably missing documents that might be useful. So, a cautionary note is to use NOT very sparingly, or to start without NOT in your statement and then you can use it later to filter out larger sets of documents.</p>
<p>Boolean retrieval also does not rank documents, so all of the terms within the document are treated at an equal level, which in some cases may be appropriate and others, not. We’ll talk more about weighted retrieval in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Concepts themselves as opposed to words are difficult to represent within the Boolean IR model, but if you use very advanced search techniques, such as nesting with Boolean operators–we can get closer to representation of concepts.</p>
<p>The last thing that I wanted to mention about Boolean is with all of these difficulties, we continue to use this model because it has been part of our IR systems for many years, and it’s a very effective way of retrieving documents even with these different potential issues that I’ve just mentioned. And our users do like to use Boolean in the sense that they like to have more options in their retrieval. But we do have new models in current environments that allow better retrieval but with less control over what the system is doing or how it’s processing your terms.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Weighted information retrieval, what is oftentimes referred to probabilistic information retrieval, is another classical IR model that we’re going to talk briefly about.</p>
<p>The Chowdhury readings include some really good instruction and explanations about weighted IR as well as some algebraic calculations if you want to pursue that even further to learn more about how systems calculate weights within IR. Weighted IR is usually in systems that have inverted indexes and index terms because what the system needs to do is have a set of terms to which it assigns weights, and it assigns weights based on the value of the word or the term within the document. So, what the system does is assign a weight to each term within the inverted index, and then within the searching process, the higher weighted documents or terms are retrieved. The weight is supposed to reflect the relative importance of a term within the document.</p>
<p>There are different schemes that are used for weighting. The most frequently used is what’s called ‘term frequency’ or ‘co-occurrence’ within a document. Basically, when we think about term frequency, it’s the number of occurrences of a term within a document, or how often a particular word appears within that document. We also can weight documents within sets. A system can examine how frequently a term occurs within the documents of a particular set. We also can look at term co-occurrence, as I mentioned, or how frequently the term appears within a document, but also in co-occurrence or in proximity to additional important or higher-weighted terms.</p>
<p>The assumption behind a weighted system then, is that the more frequently a term appears in a document, the more likely that term is to be an important concept within the document, or that it represents the overall topics being discussed within the document. One problem with this, however, is if a term is used too much within a document or the terms are used too much within the document set, or within the database system, the term becomes un-useful. We call this distinctiveness within databases; for example, if we’re searching within a system that’s filled with computer-related documents, and this is a computer science database, the term ‘computer’ is of low value in both the indexing and retrieval processes because if every document in the set is related to computers, when you do a search with the term ‘computers,’ you’re going to return every single document in the collection. So, even though weighting can be really useful, you also have to take the context or the domain into account when you’re both selecting index terms as well as when you’re selecting terms for your retrieval.</p>

<h2>Example of Weighted IR</h2>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-4050955481.png" class="r-stretch"><aside class="notes">
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of weighted IR. This is just a basic example, and I recommend that you take a closer look at the Chowdhury readings for even more information on how weighted IR works within IR systems.</p>
<p>The topic of the document is ‘information’ and ‘data retrieval.’ Some of the terms in the index might include ‘information retrieval,’ ‘data,’ ‘retrieval,’ ‘information,’ ‘system,’ ‘index,’ and ‘representation,’ and you can see from this example that this inverted index has both word and phrase indexing as possible within its structure.</p>
<p>The column on the right hand side seems to have some extraneous words, such as ‘book,’ ‘illusion,’ ‘yellow,’ ‘car,’ ‘green,’ ‘ball,’ and ‘keys.’</p>
<p>In a weighted information retrieval model, within this particular document, the terms in the left hand column are probably more frequently used within the document, and the terms in the right hand column are probably used as examples or illustrations, and they would probably have lower weights assigned.</p>
<p>How that would impact retrieval then is if you do a search for ‘information retrieval’ or ‘information AND data,’ ‘data retrieval,’ ‘system’ or ‘representation,’ you’re probably going to retrieve this document because it would have higher weights for those terms.</p>
<p>If you’re doing a search for ‘book,’ or ‘yellow’ or ‘car’ within this particular system, you’re probably not going to retrieve this document because those terms would have lower weights assigned to them.</p>

<p>There are, of course, advantages and disadvantages to the term weighting model. The advantage is that it speeds up access because those lower weighted terms are not searched, nor are they retrieved for a user. Generally, it gives a user a smaller set of documents to evaluate.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that often it is not known what weights are based on, or what the system algorithms deem as important in the weighting scale of a document. The weights are based on the system designer’s criteria; the weights are based on that particular algorithm within the system. And those weights could be wrong, or within particular documents the weights might be wrong, or the user may think that those documents are relevant, but if the lower weighted documents are missing from their set, the user may potentially miss documents that are partially useful to their information need.</p>

<p>There are other information retrieval models, such as vector space modeling, or what has been known now more recently as ‘clustering,’ Vector space modeling is one of the classical models that has been in development since the 1960s. Vector space modeling or clustering is a partial match technique, meaning that as long as part of your term is present within the document or within the document’s indexing, the document will be retrieved. It uses a weighted scheme, so the terms within the document are given weights, and what differs in a vector space model is that the queries terms are also given weights. So, documents within those sets or those clusters are ranked in decreasing order of the similarity to the query.</p>
<p>What is nice about vector space models, or ‘VIRI’s,’ as we would call a visual information retrieval interface using the vector space model, is that both the document and the query are represented as term vectors, or points on the diagram, and then the user can manipulate how close they want those vectors to coincide. The term vectors for both the document and the query are then compared for similarity.</p>

<p>So, to explain this further–you have a set of documents that are related to a specific topic, such as how to set up a habitat for lizards. In the system all of the documents in the collection on the topic of lizards are in one cluster. When the query is presented to the system, it only searches within the relevant cluster or within the vector space that’s related to that particular topic. So, those term vectors are compared for similarity. As long as the documents within each cluster accurately represent the subject of the information objects, then the search will be successful.</p>

<p>The advantage is, of course, that more useful documents seem to be retrieved. This model is really good at precision and recall and moving those measures closer together. And you can also as a user see those measures of relevance between the query terms and the document terms because you can manipulate those two factors or vectors.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that it’s a very complex system to use. Although vector space algorithms are part of a lot of commercial systems, few exist with the VIRI interface. It’s difficult to explain how it works to users, especially if they’re trying to understand about measures of similarity and the mathematical function that goes with this type of a model.</p>
<p>Vector space is not very feasible in OPACs without graphical user interfaces because you need to be able to represent those clusters and the terms and the weighting within a user interface. However, new generation OPACs and database do include faceted searching which uses the vector space/clustering model of retrieval. And IR is of course, subjective and dependent upon the use; the user has to make the determination as to how similar the query terms and the document terms are in order to have effective retrieval.</p>

<p>There are other IR models that were developed beginning in the sixties, but they really came into fruition in the nineties and in 2000s. One of these, of course, is natural language processing, or NLP. This is a semantic or a linguistic model. The Chowdhury readings explain natural language processing, so I’m not going to go into depth about it here. It’s a really complicated model. An example of systems that are using NLP are, Ask.com, the search engine. For the most part, it’s not used in a lot of commercial systems because it uses a lot of computing power, though that isn’t as much of an issue as it used to be, but it’s also subject to the foibles of human language.</p>
<p>Semantic or linguistic models, such as NLP, attempt to get at the concept levels, rather than the word levels, contained in the information documents or their surrogates. NLP is accomplished at various different levels depending on the system. Some systems using NLP do a syntactic analysis, where the system is looking at the meaning, or trying to extract the meaning of sentences, or even at the paragraph level if they’re doing paragraph indexing. Also, the system may be using a discourse analysis level, where the algorithm is looking at whole passages and trying to discern meaning and then matching queries with their semantic algorithms.</p>
<p>Free text searching and full text searching also have elements of NLP associated with it, but again, NLP is not part of many commercial systems because it does require a lot of computer power to make it work, but it also is really dependent on human language and the language within documents. So, NLP systems tend to be within more subject-specific databases rather than, say, on the web. If they’re used on the web, such as in Ask.com, it’s usually for more factual kinds of questions, and their data sets tend to be more subject-specific as opposed to being able to search everything like you can with Google.</p>

<p>There are also some other, newer IR models that emerged in the seventies, and now in the nineties with the web, and even in two-thousand with the use of, for example, user profiles that we see in Bing. Bing tracks what its users do and assembles profiles based upon the heuristics of the user searching and the whole search process when they’re using the Bing search engine. So, it uses what are called heuristics, or rules of thumb, basic rules that are present in the majority of search experiences. Bing also uses what are called process models, where the search engine looks at the entire process and tries to develop generic process models for users within the Web environment.</p>
<p>Also coming out of the seventies and eighties is the idea of intelligent agents. These were, and still are, little software programs that are supposed to be autonomous. They are able to watch and learn what a user does when they’re searching or they’re using different database systems, and then they customize the system or help give the use helpful advice whenever they come to that particular system to do a search.</p>
<p>Microsoft had an experiment with intelligent agents, with their ‘Bob’ search and software user interface, which was probably about in ’93 and ’94. You used to have that little paperclip that would pop up all the time and tell you, “Would you like to do this?” or “I can help you do this.” Bob was kind of similar to that, but Bob was a person, an agent, as opposed to a paperclip.</p>
<p>But it’s, again, an idea. It’s a newer IR model than those classic models that we talked about, and it’s something that we do continue to still explore. Cortana in Windows 10 systems is an intelligent agent. Systems like Amazon’s Alexa use both user profiles and intelligent agents to develop a profile of the users of each Alexa device.</p>
<p>Web search engines, of course, we’re all familiar with now, have really only been around since about 1993 when the World Wide Web graphical user interfaces were developed in Mosaic and in early Netscape. But web search engines, of course, are something people use every day. Web search engines don’t necessarily all work the same way. As I said, Bing has a different mechanism for searching than Google does.</p>
<p>We also have what’s called data mining, text extraction, machine learning, knowledge representation models. A lot of data mining and text extraction are based upon term frequency counts and extracting and assigning weights to terms within documents, but then also it re-purposes documents and pulls them together in very dynamic ways based upon the parameters you set for these particular processes.</p>
<p>So, within a data mining environment, we might tell the system that we need to find all the documents on a particular topic and it will extract them based upon the algorithms that have been set up in the system. Text extraction works in a similar manner; it’s really a way that we can analyze at a word level what’s in document. And we also use data mining and text extraction in some NLP systems as well to discern contextual patterns in the data.</p>
<p>Let’s look at few of the probablistic and generative IR models.</p>

<h2>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2>
<p><code>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) = Information Retrieval (IR) + Large Language Models (LLMs)</code></p>
<p>RAG is a <code>Generative IR</code> technique that helps AI models generate better, more <strong>accurate, and up-to-date</strong> responses by <strong>retrieving relevant information</strong> from external sources before generating an answer</p>
<p><code>Why Do We Need RAG?</code></p>
<p>Traditional <strong>LLMs (like GPT-4)</strong> have a <strong>fixed knowledge base</strong> from training data. But:<br>
- They <strong>don’t know new information</strong> after training.<br>
- They <strong>hallucinate</strong> (make up facts).<br>
- They <strong>struggle with specific or niche knowledge</strong> (e.g., latest research papers).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution: RAG helps by searching for relevant documents and using them to generate accurate answers!</strong></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>With the recent advancement in generative AI, we can use large language models for information retrieval.</p>
<p>LLMs are trained on massive datasets, but once training stops, their knowledge is frozen in time. So, if something happens after their last update—like a new scientific discovery—they have no idea about it and they start hallucinating.</p>
<p>Hallucination is defined as when a model generates something that sounds convincing but isn’t actually true. This is a big problem in applications like medicine or law, where accuracy is crucial.</p>
<p>So, how do we fix these issues? That’s where RAG comes in!</p>
<p>Instead of just relying on pre-trained knowledge, a RAG model first retrieves relevant information from an external source—like a database, Wikipedia, or even real-time web searches—and then generates a response using that data.</p>
<p>This means RAG models are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More up-to-date: Because they pull in fresh, external knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>More accurate: Since they ground their responses in retrieved facts.</p></li>
<li><p>Less prone to hallucination: Because they verify information before generating text.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>There are a lot of different information retrieval systems that you as a user encounter every day: library online catalogs, online databases, such as OU Libraries database, but there are also databases on the web that you use and that are being used without you even knowing it–say, for example, Google Scholar is a database,–and of course, your search engines within the web. There’s a really good resource that you might at some point take a look at. It’s a little complicated because it’s trying to be everything to every type of user.</p>
<p>And that’s the Search Engine Watch page–<a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/" class="uri">https://searchenginewatch.com/</a>. It has news about what’s going on in search engine development, it talks about the mechanics of search engines and search engine optimization, etc. Social media sites are also an example of a system you may use.</p>
<p>As you use different IR systems every day, think about</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How these different systems employ different IR methods and models?</p></li>
<li><p>How is the system structured?</p></li>
<li><p>What aspects of the system are hidden from the user?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Try to determine the structure of the system and how you retrieve information by examining the interface features, such as a drop down options or field lists in an online database, or features designed to enable fielded searching in your online catalogs. For example, what fields are searchable? Can you conduct Boolean searches?</p>

<p>Image 1: Okay, let’s look at some requirements for a successful retrieval. We have a collection. It is shown on this slide with these various different symbols, which may or may not be useful to us as a user. <code>(Click Next)</code></p>
<p>Image 2: Within our collection, there is at least one document, based on its representation that might be useful to us. <code>(Click Next)</code></p>
<p>Image 3: The user has some idea of what kind of information or information resource would be useful to them in helping to satisfy an information need. So, they input that information into the search mechanism of the information retrieval system with the hopes of enacting a match between their search terms and the terms used within the system to represent the objects on that particular topic, subject, or by a particular author.</p>
<p>So, we can say that retrieval was successful because at least one of the terms, the search terms that the user input into the system, matched with the terms in the representation and brought back the document or resource that the user thought might be useful. <code>(Click Next)</code></p>
<p>Image 4: So, we have a patron! <code>(Click Next)</code></p>
<p>Image 5: With a very specific information need. <code>(Click Next)</code></p>
<p>Image 6: When the indexer created this representation, they picked the four symbols that you see in the pink bar. And these symbols are represented within this document. Now, again, what they’ve done is chosen to <em>highlight</em> specific attributes of this object for their representation. So, we can see four different aspects that were probably more important topics within this object, and that’s what the cataloger/indexer chose to represent. Also, they might be constrained by their system parameters or local practice as to how many concepts they can represent instead of representing every concept within the document.</p>
<p>What’s also not known to the user at this point are the conventions (local practice rules in the cataloging department) and the different choices that the indexer must make.</p>

<p>Part of the problem also is that the indexer and the patron often do not use the same code.</p>
<p>Or in this case, we can think of the controlled vocabulary, Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), as the code that we use to represent subjects within our particular representations or records within our system.</p>
<p>Patrons in libraries do not usually have an understanding about what the four big, red books, or LCSH, contain and how they can be used in searching. And oftentimes, especially today in the automated world in which we live, we don’t provide the LSCH in online or print form to our users as a potential source of topics or search terms.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Earlier, we talked about users and what we can know about users. So, at this point, let’s also consider “What patron attributes can we know?</p>
<p>We can know about their age, we can know about their economic status potentially, depending on where they’re accessing our collection. We can know about their gender. We might know about the particular use. So, there are different aspects of patrons we can know about. Now that we’re in an online environment, knowing who our users are is very difficult, and our representations reflect that difficulty by becoming more general in nature.</p>
<p>We also can know what document attributes are useful within our systems. And how we determine this is oftentimes through user studies, in which we talk to users about how they use our systems, or how they use collections, or how they conduct searching within different systems.</p>
<p>So, how can we use this knowledge to open up what we would consider the ‘bottleneck’ between patrons with a particular information need and the documents that might be of use to them?</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>There are other indexing factors that do effect information retrieval (IR) performance, and some of these are related back to human factors.</p>
<p>For example, within the indexing process and resulting index , there is a problem that we call ‘inter - indexer consistency,’ or ‘inter - indexer inconsistency,’ meaning that there is a low percentage of consistency between any two indexers when they’re creating representations.</p>
<p>There is also the problem with subject expertise. People with higher domain knowledge, generally, are better indexers in that particular area.</p>
<p>And also indexers with more experience tend to know the codes or the controlled vocabularies better, as well as how representations are structured.</p>
<p>Then there are also factors from the user’s side such as the types and levels of knowledge, the user’s search experience and domain knowledge; these factors can also play a role in retrieval performance.</p>
<p>There are also effective and cognitive factors, such as a person’s motivation level and emotional state as they’re looking for information.</p>

<h2>Other Factors to Consider</h2>

<aside class="notes">
<p>One final set of factors to consider – and I’m sure that you can also think of others – is that the indexer or cataloger has specific standards and rules, or what we might refer to as a code, that have to be followed when they create representations.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering the codes or standards we use in library cataloging or indexing in more depth coming in future modules 6 and 7. Those standards and rules depend on the form of the index or the abstract or the record being created; they also depend on criteria of employers, such as how many pages are allocated for an index, what format can be used, how will the information be structured and displayed to the users, what is the particular order of the elements of the record, etc.</p>
<p>Again, all of this depends upon which type of organizing structure of the IR system. For example a library catalog or OPAC contains records created by library catalogers who use standards for both descriptive cataloging and subject cataloging. In a database, they may use similar standards, such as choosing subject terms from a controlled vocabulary such as LCSH but the database proprietor may use different standards or controlled vocabularies.</p>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-158779916.png" class="r-stretch"><aside class="notes">
<p>Now that you have a basic introduction to information retrieval and some of the models that help in retrieval in different systems, let’s talk about how this relates to searching. It’s important that we understand how our different systems are structured and also what model of retrieval is running the algorithms behind the scenes or behind the interface, if you will. The organization of the record within the file is what holds the key as well as those algorithms.</p>
<p>In earlier systems, our methods for finding the location of the record and for matching representations from the user, their search terms, and representations within the records was a sequential search of all the records in a file, and as you can imagine, this took a great deal of time. Most of our systems nowadays use either an inverted index file, which is an individual index for every field that is searchable within our system or they use keyword searching. In some of the newer systems, we might even have full text searching.</p>
<p>So, there are different ways in which you can enact a query, but the system is generally searching an inverted index of those fields that have been deemed searchable. Within bibliographic records, especially those that have OPACs, we often have multiple indexes which provide searchable fields for our users.</p>

<h2>Types of IR Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Coordinate systems
<ul>
<li>printed indexes and catalogs</li>
<li>OPACs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post-Coordinate systems</li>
<li>Computer retrieval systems (Databases)</li>
<li>Online retrieval systems (Internet and Web)</li>
<li>Smart phones</li>
<li>Tablet, computers</li>
<li>Others you use? Can we consider Social Media an IR system? Can we consider all Chatbots as IR system or just the modern ones powered by LLMs?</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I have listed a few types of IR systems that we will address this semester. Today, users access information from MANY different devices and expect them all to work basically the same way. They want quick, easy, effective, ubiquitous access 24/7.</p>
<p>How do these expectations affect what users want from IR systems? We will come back to this point later throughout the semester.</p>
<p>As you use different IR systems every day, think about how these different systems employ different IR methods and models.</p>
<ul>
<li>How is the system structured?</li>
<li>What aspects of the system are hidden from the user?</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to determine the structure of the system and how you retrieve information by examining the interface features, such as a drop down options or field lists in an online database, or features designed to enable fielded searching in your online catalogs. For example, what fields are searchable? Can you conduct Boolean searches.</p>

<h2>Cautions</h2>
<ul>
<li>We should take a more global view of IR</li>
<li>Users (including information professionals) need to know which IR model or technique the system is using for retrieval</li>
<li>Users also need to know how information systems are structured and how objects are represented in the system</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I want to mention just a few cautions when we’re thinking about information retrieval and information retrieval models. When we designed these systems, we were designing the models and the systems for local use. We didn’t have the networked connections that we have presently; we didn’t have the World Wide Web back in the sixties; so, we were designing systems that could be used in a local context.</p>
<p>So, at this point, we really need to take more of a global perspective when we’re thinking about information retrieval. If we’re designing a system or we’re creating representations, we need to think about the global community that might be accessing this system.</p>
<p>We also as users, and this includes information professionals, need to know which information model or technique the system is using for retrieval. What I mean here is that whenever you start using a database, it will save you a lot of time and effort if you familiarize yourself first with the different search functionalities that you have, if you can get a sense of the IR model that’s being used, and you can look for some of those more advanced search filters or functions, such as stemming and proximity searching, that might be present within that system.</p>
<p>Also try to find out if it has a thesaurus function where you can have access as a searcher to the controlled vocabulary used by the system for its indexing. Using the thesaurus feature, if applicable in that system, will make your searching more precise to begin with.</p>
<p>Users also need to know how information systems are structured, what the field structure is, what the indexing system is, and how their objects are represented within the system, which fields are searchable, if there is an inverted index that is being searched, is it both word and phrase searched, or indexed. Each of these elements of system structure are going to impact how you’re going to conduct your search queries but also how effective retrieval will be.</p>
<p>In the next topic we’re going to dig deeper and talk about some different search strategies and features you can use to make searching even more precise.</p>
<p>Next week, we will discuss strategies and techniques to use while searching and delve deeper into the reference interview process.</p>
