## What Search terms Should I Use? {.smaller}

*There are no wrong answers here*

::::::::::: columns
:::::: {.column width="50%"}
::::: increment
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Use the word "tear" in a short sentence
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2.  Were you thinking

    ![](images/1.png){width="344"}

Interesting. Okay, let's go on to the next question.
:::
:::::
::::::

:::::: {.column width="50%"}
::::: increment
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
3.  Use ONE (and only one) word to describe this picture.

# Language is Complicated

::: notes
Do you see the pattern in the previous questions? What might seem like a
simple word or an easy name can actually be quite complicated. This
makes searching, especially in a library database, just a little more
challenging. The good news is that if you learn a bit about the way a
database works, you will be able to find useful information much more
quickly.
:::

## Find It

![](images/4.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

::: notes
Have you ever used the "find" option in a document? Let's say you want
to find the word "zombie" but a few times you decided to spell it
"zomby" and once you misspelled it "zmbie". Will it "find" either of
these? No, because you told it to look for "zombie".

But **why cannot you find anything helpful?**

A database is like a more complicated version of that "find" option. A
database just uses the input you give in the search boxes to "find"
items that match. Most databases can search for multiple terms at once
or cross-reference to narrow or broaden the results. But it can only do
that based on the information YOU give it.
:::

# Databases Cannot Think

::: notes
If you are looking for an article on the world, but the database uses
the word "earth" you may not get many results. Or you might even get
zero results. This might make you think the database has nothing useful
to offer. Or say you need to write a paper on the Greek god Mercury. You
search for the word "mercury" but get results mostly about the element
mercury and the planet mercury. There might be a lot of results, but
they might not be useful ones. **This is where controlled vocabulary can
help!**
:::

# Why Do We Need to Control the Vocabulary?

::: notes
Controlled vocabulary is what sets a database apart from a general
"find" search or a general web search. Every article, essay, or item in
a database has been "tagged" with terms that let you know what it is
about.
:::

# ![](images/5.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
Think of a picture you post on your Instagram. You can tag a picture
with anybody's name and there would be no one who could stop you.

In fact, any of your friends could, depending on your privacy settigns,
tag anyone they wanted in one of your pictures.
:::

# Tag, You're It!

::: notes
With the library databases, the tagging for subject terms is controlled.
People such as librarians, authors, and publishers have taken time and
effort to match articles and books to accurate "tags" or "SUBJECT
TERMS".

These terms are not perfect -- after all, librarians are people too --
but they are designed tp gather information in a more specific way.
:::

# Choices, Choices

::: notes
There are different ways you can use subject terms. We will review two
ways that you might find most helpful. The first is doing a broad search
and selecting a subject term or terms from the results. The second is to
use the database's Thesaurus to find subject terms.

In next few slides, I will be using EBSCOhost Academic Search Complete
for my examples. Every database has its own quirks and differences, but
these broader principles can be applied to many if not most of them.

## You Have to Start Somewhere

![](images/6.png){fig-align="center" width="550" height="550"}
![](images/7.png){fig-align="center" width="500" height="100"}

::: notes
In AE#4, you had the experience understanding the different
functionalities of the database assigned to you. You tried doing a
search using the limits that are available. Try it again with some
different database. Use more than one search term and limiting it to
peer review only, for example, you can make your result list a little
more manageable.

Do not be afraid to try something. The worst that could happen is that
you have to try a new search.

Even though this search only brought up 4 results, there might be
something useful here. Even if none of these articles are useful, their
subject terms might help us find what we need. The subject terms are
located under the description of the articles.
:::

## Hyperlinked!

![](images/8.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
If you click on results to get the full description, a lot of databases
offer subject terms as **hyperlinks**. Clicking on a subject term will
bring up all the other articles that are also tagged with that subject
term.
:::

## Special Designators

![](images/9.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
By clicking on the hyperlink, the database will use a code to let the
search know you are looking for a subject term. For Academic Search
Complete this designator is **DE**. It will be different for different
databases. Now that we know what it is, we can use it to combine
multiple subject terms.
:::

## Mix and Match

![](images/10.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
If the subject term contains more than one word, using quotation marks
will tell the database to look for phrase instead of 2 individual words.
We can pull subject terms from different articles to get more precise
results. See what happens when we use the subject term "ILLEGAL aliens"
from our first result and "IMMIGRANTS" from our second results.

You may have to mix and match different subject terms to get the results
you really want. Or to narrow the list down so it won't take you 14
hours to sort through! And if your first search does not bring your
articles that have useful subject terms you will have to try other
general searches to try find some.

`It's called REsearch because you have to search and search again!!`

All this is good, but maybe you want to just start with the subject
terms. Is there a way to do that? I am glad you asked!
:::

## Thesaurus

![](images/11.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
A lot of databases (though not all) offer a thesaurus or list of subject
terms. These differ based on the database, but if there is one it can
save you some time. Academic Search Complete simply says
`"Subject Terms"` at the top. And clicking on it will bring up a new
kind of search screen.

This search is designed to help you find specific subject terms, so be
as simple and straightforward as possible. There are two options:
`"Terms begin with"` and `"Term contains"`

Start with `"Terms begin with"` but if few to no results come up, try
`"Term contains"` to broaden the results.
:::

## Term Begins With

![](images/14.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

::: notes
See on the slide how `"Terms begin with"` differentiates between the
different kinds of mercury? It will help you focus in on just the type
that you need.

When you click on a term, it will give you more information:

-   `"Scope Note"` will let you know what that subject term is used for

-   `"Broader Terms"` are subject terms that will open your search up
    further

-   `"Related Terms"` are other subject terms that are very similar or
    synonyms

-   `"Used For"` shows terms that are not subject terms in the database.
    This lets you know that you should use the official subject term
    instead

*\[`Click Next` to view the pictures\]*

If you have found the subject terms you need, the thesaurus usually
makes it pretty easy to add them to your search. Select the check box of
the term(s) you want to use.

If you are selecting more than one term and you want to expand your
search to results that contain either or both subject term, use the "OR"
connector to expand your search.

If you are selecting more than one term and you want to limit your
search to ONLY results that have BOTH terms use the "AND" connector.

For more on "OR" and "AND" connectors watch last week's lecture on
searching techniques and strategies.

Clicking the "Add" button will automatically put the search terms into
the search box. You can then look for more subject terms or perform your
search.
:::

## Compare and Contrast

![](images/18.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
So here’s a great example of why using subject terms can make your
searching so much easier.

On the left, I just typed “mercury” as a keyword. The database gave me
over 32,000 results — way too many! And as you can see, most of them are
about mercury the chemical element — pollution, water studies,
toxicology — nothing to do with the Greek god Mercury that I was
actually looking for.

Now, on the right, I used subject terms instead. That means I told the
database exactly what concept I wanted — in this case, Mercury or
Hermes, the Greek or Roman god. And look at the difference: only 41
results, all much more focused on my topic.

Keywords just look for words anywhere in the record, but subject terms
capture meaning. Using them helps you move from thousands of random hits
to a manageable set of relevant ones.
:::

## Another Quick Note About Thesaurus

![](images/19.png){fig-align="center" width="700"} 

:::notes 

Here’s another quick note about using the thesaurus in databases.

If I search for the term “attorney,” I get a message saying that term
isn’t found. But the database helps me out by offering suggestions — and
notice what it shows: most of the recommended terms use “lawyer” instead
of “attorney.”

That tells me that in this database, “lawyer” is the preferred term. So,
if I want to find all the relevant results, I should use “lawyer” when
building my search.

You can also click on any of these suggestions to explore related
subjects or run a new search with “lawyer” to see even more options.

So, when your search term doesn’t show up, don’t panic! The thesaurus
can guide you to the right subject term that the database actually uses.
:::

# Putting it Together

::: notes
Subject Terms are like "tags" that have been attached to items in a
database to make them easier to find. You can find them attached to an
article or item and use those subject terms to find other similar items.
Or you can use a thesaurus or subject term list to find subject terms to
focus your search.

Now, you know a little bit more about the way Subject Terms work in a
database. Playing around with them can help save you time when you are
doing research for a project. The more familiar you are with the way a
database works, the easier it will be to find items that are useful.
